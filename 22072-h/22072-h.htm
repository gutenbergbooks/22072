<h2>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>


<p>It might have been expected that the Indians of
North America would have many Folklore tales
to tell, and in this volume I have endeavoured to
present such of them as seemed to me to best
illustrate the primitive character and beliefs of
the people. The belief, and the language in
which it is clothed, are often very beautiful.
Fantastic imagination, magnanimity, moral sentiment,
tender feeling, and humour are discovered
in a degree which may astonish many who have
been apt to imagine that advanced civilisation
has much to do with the possession of such
qualities. I know of nothing that throws so
much light upon Indian character as their
Folk-tales.</p>

<h2>MOOWIS.</h2>


<p>In a large village there lived a noted belle, or Ma-mon-d&aacute;-go-Kwa,
who was the admiration of all the
young hunters and warriors. She was particularly
admired by a young man who, from his good figure
and the care he took in his dress, was called the
Beau-Man, or Ma-mon-d&aacute;-gin-in-e. This young man
had a friend and companion whom he made his
confidant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he one day, in a sportive mood,
&ldquo;let us go a-courting to her who is so handsome,
perhaps she may fancy one of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would, however, listen to neither of them;
and when the handsome young man rallied her on
the coldness of her air, and made an effort to overcome
her indifference, she repulsed him with the
greatest contempt, and the young man retired confused
and abashed. His sense of pride was deeply
wounded, and he was the more piqued because he
had been thus treated in the presence of others,
and this affair had been noised about in the village,
and became the talk of every lodge circle. He was,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
besides, a very sensitive man, and the incident so
preyed upon him that he became moody and at
last took to his bed. For days he would lie without
uttering a word, with his eyes fixed on vacancy,
and taking little or no food. From this state no
efforts could rouse him. He felt abashed and dishonoured
even in the presence of his own relatives,
and no persuasions could induce him to rise, so that
when the family prepared to take down the lodge
to remove he still kept his bed, and they were compelled
to lift it from above his head and leave him
upon his skin couch. It was a time of general removal
and breaking up of the camp, for it was only
a winter hunting-camp, and as the season of the hunt
was now over, and spring began to appear, his friends
all moved off as by one impulse to the place of their
summer village, and in a short time all were gone,
and he was left alone. The last person to leave him
was his boon companion and cousin, who had been,
like him, an admirer of the forest belle. The hunter
disregarded even his voice, and as soon as his steps
died away on the creaking snow the stillness and
solitude of the wilderness reigned around.</p>

<p>As soon as all were gone, and he could no longer,
by listening, hear the remotest sound of the departing
camp, the Beau-Man arose.</p>

<p>Now this young man had for a friend a powerful
guardian spirit or personal manito, and he resolved,
with this spirit&rsquo;s aid, to use his utmost power to
punish and humble the girl, for she was noted in
her tribe for her coquetry, and had treated many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
young men, who were every way her equals, as she
had treated this lover. He resolved on a singular
stratagem by way of revenge.</p>

<p>He walked over the deserted camp and gathered
up all the cast-off bits of soiled cloth, clippings
of finery, and old clothing and ornaments, which
had either been left there as not worth carrying
away, or forgotten. These he carefully picked out of
the snow, into which some of them had been trodden,
and collected in one place. These gaudy and soiled
stuffs he restored to their original beauty, and made
of them a coat and leggings, which he trimmed with
beads, and finished and decorated after the best fashion
of his tribe. He then made a pair of moccasins and
garnished them with beads, a bow and arrows,
and a frontlet and feathers for the head. Having
done this he searched about for cast-out bones of
animals, pieces of skin, clippings of dried meat, and
even dirt. Having cemented all this together he
filled the clothes with it, pressed the mass firmly
in, and fashioned it, externally, in all respects like
a tall and well-shaped man. He put a bow and
arrows in its hands, and the frontlet on its head.
Having finished it he brought it to life, and the image
stood forth in the most favoured lineaments of his
fellows. Such was the origin of Moowis, or the
Dirt-and-Rag Man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said the Beau-Man, &ldquo;and I will
direct you how you shall act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moowis was, indeed, a very sightly person, and
as the Beau-Man led him into the new encampment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
where the girl dwelt, the many colours of his clothes,
the profusion of his ornaments, his manly deportment,
his animated countenance, drew all eyes to him.
He was hospitably received, both old and young
showing him great attention. The chief invited him
to his lodge, and he was there treated to the moose&rsquo;s
hump and the finest venison.</p>

<p>No one was better pleased with the handsome
stranger than Ma-mon-d&aacute;-go-Kwa. She fell in love
with him at first sight, and he was an invited guest
at the lodge of her mother the very first evening of
his arrival. The Beau-Man went with him, for it was
under his patronage that he had been introduced,
and, in truth, he had another motive in accompanying
him, for he had not yet wholly subdued his feelings
of admiration for the object against whom he had,
nevertheless, exerted all his necromantic power, and
he held himself ready to take advantage of any
favourable turn which he secretly hoped the visit
might take in relation to himself. No such opportunity,
however, arose. Moowis attracted the chief
attention, every eye and heart was alert to entertain
him. In this effort on the part of his entertainers
they had well-nigh brought about his destruction
by dissolving him into his original elements of rags,
snow, and dirt, for he was assigned the most prominent
place near the fire, where he was exposed to a heat
that he could by no means endure. However, he
warded this calamity off by placing a boy between
him and the fire; he shifted his position frequently,
and evaded, by dexterous man&oelig;uvres and timely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
remarks, the pressing invitation of his host to sit
and enjoy the warmth. He so managed these
excuses as not only to conceal his dread of immediate
dissolution, but to secure the further approbation of
the fair forest girl, who was filled with admiration
of one who had so brave a spirit to endure the
paralysing effects of cold.</p>

<p>The visit proved that the rejected lover had well
calculated the effects of his plan. He withdrew
from the lodge, and Moowis triumphed. Before the
Beau-Man left he saw him cross the lodge to the
coveted <i>abinos</i>, or bridegroom&rsquo;s seat. The dart
which Ma-mon-d&aacute;-go-Kwa had so often delighted in
sending to the hearts of her admirers she was at
length fated to receive. She had married an image.</p>

<p>As the morning began to break the stranger arose,
adjusted his warrior&rsquo;s plumes, and took his forest
weapons to depart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I have important work
to do, and there are many hills and streams between
me and the object of my journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go with you,&rdquo; said Ma-mon-d&aacute;-go-Kwa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The journey is too long,&rdquo; replied her husband, &ldquo;and
you are ill able to encounter the perils of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not so long but that I will go,&rdquo; answered
his wife, &ldquo;and there are no dangers I will not share
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moowis returned to the lodge of his master, and
told him what had occurred. For a moment pity
took possession of the young man&rsquo;s heart. He
regretted that she whom he so loved should thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
have thrown herself away upon an image, a shadow,
when she might have been the mistress of the best
lodge in the camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is her own folly,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she has turned
a deaf ear to the counsels of prudence. She must
submit to her fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same morning Moowis set forth, and his wife
followed him at a distance. The way was rough and
intricate, and she found that she could not keep up
with him, he walked so quickly. She struggled hard
and obstinately to overtake him, but Moowis had
been for some time out of sight when the sun rose
and commenced upon his snow-formed body the
work of dissolution. He began to melt away and
fall to pieces. As Ma-mon-d&aacute;-go-Kwa followed in
his track she found piece after piece of his clothing
in the path. She first found his mittens, then his
moccasins, then his leggings, then his coat, and after
that other parts of his garments. As the heat unbound
them the clothes also returned to their filthy condition.
Over rocks, through wind-falls, across marshes,
Ma-mon-d&aacute;-go-Kwa pursued him she loved. The path
turned aside in all directions. Rags, bones, leather,
beads, feathers, and soiled ribbons she found, but
caught no sight of Moowis. She spent the day in
wandering, and when evening came she was still
alone. The snow having now melted, she had completely
lost her husband&rsquo;s track, and she wandered
about uncertain which way to go and in a state of
perfect despair. At length with bitter cries she
lamented her fate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
&ldquo;Moowis, Moowis,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;nin ge won e win
ig, ne won e win ig!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Moowis, Moowis, you have
led me astray, you are leading me astray!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this cry she wandered in the woods.</p>

<p>The cry of the lost Ma-mon-d&aacute;-go-Kwa is sometimes
repeated by the village girls who have made
of it a song&mdash;</p>

<h2>THE GIRL WHO MARRIED THE PINE-TREE.</h2>


<p>Upon the side of a certain mountain grew some pines,
under the shade of which the Puckwudjinies, or
sprites, were accustomed to sport at times. Now it
happened that in the neighbourhood of these trees
was a lodge in which dwelt a beautiful girl and her
father and mother. One day a man came to the lodge
of the father, and seeing the girl he loved her, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me Leelinau for my wife,&rdquo; and the old man
consented.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the girl did not like her
lover, so she escaped from the lodge and went and
hid herself, and as the sun was setting she came to
the pine-trees, and leaning against one of them she
lamented her hard fate. On a sudden she heard
a voice, which seemed to come from the tree,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be my wife, maiden, beautiful Leelinau, beautiful
Leelinau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl was astonished, not knowing whence the
voice could have come. She listened again, and the
words were repeated, evidently by the tree against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
which she leaned. Then the maid consented to be
the wife of the pine-tree.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her parents had missed her, and had
sent out parties to see if she could be found, but
she was nowhere.</p>

<p>Time passed on, but Leelinau never returned to
her home. Hunters who have been crossing the
mountain, and have come to the trees at sunset, say
that they have seen a beautiful girl there in company
with a handsome youth, who vanished as they

<h2>A LEGEND OF MANABOZHO.</h2>


<p>Manabozho made the land. The occasion of his
doing so was this.</p>

<p>One day he went out hunting with two wolves.
After the first day&rsquo;s hunt one of the wolves left him
and went to the left, but the other continuing with
Manabozho he adopted him for his son. The lakes
were in those days peopled by spirits with whom
Manabozho and his son went to war. They destroyed
all the spirits in one lake, and then went on hunting.
They were not, however, very successful, for
every deer the wolf chased fled to another of the
lakes and escaped from them. It chanced that one
day Manabozho started a deer, and the wolf gave
chase. The animal fled to the lake, which was
covered with ice, and the wolf pursued it. At the
moment when the wolf had come up to the prey the
ice broke, and both fell in, when the spirits, catching
them, at once devoured them.</p>

<p>Manabozho went up and down the lake-shore
weeping and lamenting. While he was thus distressed
he heard a voice proceeding from the depths
of the lake.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
&ldquo;Manabozho,&rdquo; cried the voice, &ldquo;why do you
weep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manabozho answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I not cause to do so? I have lost my
son, who has sunk in the waters of the lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will never see him more,&rdquo; replied the voice;
&ldquo;the spirits have eaten him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Manabozho wept the more when he heard
this sad news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I might meet those who have
thus cruelly treated me in eating my son. They
should feel the power of Manabozho, who would be
revenged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice informed him that he might meet the
spirits by repairing to a certain place, to which the
spirits would come to sun themselves. Manabozho
went there accordingly, and, concealing himself, saw
the spirits, who appeared in all manner of forms,
as snakes, bears, and other things. Manabozho,
however, did not escape the notice of one of the
two chiefs of the spirits, and one of the band who
wore the shape of a very large snake was sent by
them to examine what the strange object was.</p>

<p>Manabozho saw the spirit coming, and assumed
the appearance of a stump. The snake coming up
wrapped itself around the trunk and squeezed it
with all its strength, so that Manabozho was on the
point of crying out when the snake uncoiled itself.
The relief was, however, only for a moment. Again
the snake wound itself around him and gave him
this time even a more severe hug than before.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Manabozho restrained himself and did not suffer a
cry to escape him, and the snake, now satisfied that
the stump was what it appeared to be, glided off to
its companions. The chiefs of the spirits were not,
however, satisfied, so they sent a bear to try what
he could make of the stump. The bear came up to
Manabozho and hugged, and bit, and clawed him
till he could hardly forbear screaming with the pain
it caused him. The thought of his son and of the
vengeance he wished to take on the spirits, however,
restrained him, and the bear at last retreated
to its fellows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;it is really a stump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the spirits were reassured, and, having sunned
themselves, lay down and went to sleep. Seeing
this, Manabozho assumed his natural shape, and stealing
upon them with his bow and arrows, slew the
chiefs of the spirits. In doing this he awoke the
others, who, seeing their chiefs dead, turned upon
Manabozho, who fled. Then the spirits pursued him
in the shape of a vast flood of water. Hearing it
behind him the fugitive ran as fast as he could to
the hills, but each one became gradually submerged,
so that Manabozho was at last driven to the top of
the highest mountain. Here the waters still surrounding
him and gathering in height, Manabozho
climbed the highest pine-tree he could find. The
waters still rose. Then Manabozho prayed that the
tree would grow, and it did so. Still the waters
rose. Manabozho prayed again that the tree would
grow, and it did so, but not so much as before.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Still the waters rose, and Manabozho was up to his
chin in the flood, when he prayed again, and the tree
grew, but less than on either of the former occasions.
Manabozho looked round on the waters, and saw many
animals swimming about seeking land. Amongst
them he saw a beaver, an otter, and a musk-rat.
Then he cried to them, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brothers, come to me. We must have some
earth, or we shall all die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they came to him and consulted as to what
had best be done, and it was agreed that they should
dive down and see if they could not bring up some
of the earth from below.</p>

<p>The beaver dived first, but was drowned before he
reached the bottom. Then the otter went. He came
within sight of the earth, but then his senses failed
him before he could get a bite of it. The musk-rat
followed. He sank to the bottom, and bit the earth.
Then he lost his senses and came floating up to the
top of the water. Manabozho awaited the reappearance
of the three, and as they came up to the
surface he drew them to him. He examined their
claws, but found nothing. Then he looked in their
mouths and found the beaver&rsquo;s and the otter&rsquo;s empty.
In the musk-rat&rsquo;s, however, he found a little earth.
This Manabozho took in his hands and rubbed till
it was a fine dust. Then he dried it in the sun, and,
when it was quite light, he blew it all round him over
the water, and the dry land appeared.</p>

<p>Thus Manabozho made the land.</p>

<h2>PAUPPUKKEEWIS.</h2>


<p>A man of large stature and great activity of mind
and body found himself standing alone on a prairie.
He thought to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came I here? Are there no beings on this
earth but myself? I must travel and see. I must
walk till I find the abodes of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So as soon as his mind was made up he set out,
he knew not whither, in search of habitations. No
obstacles diverted him from his purpose. Prairies,
rivers, woods, and storms did not daunt his courage
or turn him back. After travelling a long time he
came to a wood in which he saw decayed stumps of
trees, as if they had been cut in ancient times, but
he found no other traces of men. Pursuing his
journey he found more recent marks of the same kind,
and later on he came to fresh traces of human beings,
first their footsteps, and then the wood they had
cut lying in heaps.</p>

<p>Continuing on he emerged towards dusk from the
forest, and beheld at a distance a large village of
high lodges, standing on rising ground. He said
to himself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
&ldquo;I will arrive there at a run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off he started with all his speed, and on coming
to the first lodge he jumped over it. Those within
saw something pass over the top, and then they
heard a thump on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; they all said.</p>

<p>One came out to see, and, finding a stranger, invited
him in. He found himself in the presence of an
old chief and several men who were seated in the
lodge. Meat was set before him, after which the
chief asked him where he was going and what his
name was. He answered he was in search of adventures,
and that his name was Pauppukkeewis (grasshopper).
The eyes of all were fixed upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pauppukkeewis!&rdquo; said one to another, and the
laugh went round.</p>

<p>Pauppukkeewis made but a short stay in the village.
He was not easy there. The place gave him
no opportunity to display his powers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be off,&rdquo; he said, and taking with him a
young man who had formed a strong attachment
for him and who might serve him as a mesh-in-au-wa
(official who bears the pipe), he set out once
more on his travels. The two travelled together,
and when the young man was fatigued with walking
Pauppukkeewis would show him a few tricks, such
as leaping over trees, and turning round on one
leg till he made the dust fly in a cloud around
him. In this manner he very much amused his companion,
though at times his performance somewhat
alarmed him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
One day they came to a large village, where they
were well received. The people told them that there
were a number of manitoes who lived some distance
away and who killed all who came to their lodge.</p>

<p>The people had made many attempts to extirpate
these manitoes, but the war parties that went out
for this purpose were always unsuccessful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go and see them,&rdquo; said Pauppukkeewis.</p>

<p>The chief of the village warned him of the danger
he would run, but finding him resolved, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you will go, since you are my guest,
I will send twenty warriors with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pauppukkeewis thanked him for this. Twenty
young men offered themselves for the expedition.
They went forward, and in a short time descried the
lodge of the manitoes. Pauppukkeewis placed his
friend and the warriors near him so that they might
see all that passed, and then he went alone into
the lodge. When he entered he found five horrible-looking
manitoes eating. These were the father and
four sons. Their appearance was hideous. Their
eyes were set low in their heads as if the manitoes
were half starved. They offered Pauppukkeewis part
of their meat, but he refused it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you come for?&rdquo; asked the old one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Pauppukkeewis.</p>

<p>At this they all stared at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not wish to wrestle?&rdquo; they all asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

<p>A hideous smile passed over their faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go,&rdquo; said the others to their eldest brother.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Pauppukkeewis and his antagonist were soon
clinched in each other&rsquo;s arms. He knew the manitoes&rsquo;
object,&mdash;they wanted his flesh,&mdash;but he was prepared
for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haw, haw!&rdquo; they cried, and the dust and dry
leaves flew about the wrestlers as if driven by a
strong wind.</p>

<p>The manito was strong, but Pauppukkeewis soon
found he could master him. He tripped him up,
and threw him with a giant&rsquo;s force head foremost
on a stone, and he fell insensible.</p>

<p>The brothers stepped up in quick succession, but
Pauppukkeewis put his tricks in full play, and soon
all the four lay bleeding on the ground. The old
manito got frightened, and ran for his life. Pauppukkeewis
pursued him for sport. Sometimes he
was before him, sometimes over his head. Now he
would give him a kick, now a push, now a trip, till
the manito was quite exhausted. Meanwhile Pauppukkeewis&rsquo;s
friend and the warriors came up, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, a! Ha, ha, a! Pauppukkeewis is driving
him before him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At length Pauppukkeewis threw the manito to
the ground with such force that he lay senseless,
and the warriors, carrying him off, laid him with
the bodies of his sons, and set fire to the whole,
consuming them to ashes.</p>

<p>Around the lodge Pauppukkeewis and his friends
saw a large number of bones, the remains of the
warriors whom the manitoes had slain. Taking
three arrows, Pauppukkeewis called upon the Great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Spirit, and then, shooting an arrow in the air, he
cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, who are lying down, rise up, or you will
be hit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bones at these words all collected in one
place. Again Pauppukkeewis shot another arrow
into the air, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, who are lying down, rise up, or you will be
hit,&rdquo; and each bone drew towards its fellow.</p>

<p>Then he shot a third arrow, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, who are lying down, rise up, or you will
be hit,&rdquo; and the bones immediately came together,
flesh came over them, and the warriors, whose remains
they were, stood before Pauppukkeewis alive and well.</p>

<p>He led them to the chief of the village, who had
been his friend, and gave them up to him. Soon
after, the chief with his counsellors came to him,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is more worthy to rule than you? You
alone can defend us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pauppukkeewis thanked the chief, but told him he
must set out again in search of further adventures.
The chief and the counsellors pressed him to remain,
but he was resolved to leave them, and so he told
the chief to make his friend ruler while he himself
went on his travels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will come again,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sometime and
see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; they all cried, &ldquo;come back again
and see us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He promised that he would, and set out alone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
After travelling for some time, he came to a large
lake, and on looking about he saw an enormous
otter on an island. He thought to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His skin will make me a fine pouch,&rdquo; and, drawing
near, he drove an arrow into the otter&rsquo;s side.
He waded into the lake, and with some difficulty
dragged the carcass ashore. He took out the entrails,
but even then the carcass was so heavy that it
was as much as he could do to drag it up a hill
overlooking the lake. As soon as he got it into the
sunshine, where it was warm, he skinned the otter,
and threw the carcass away, for he said to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The war-eagle will come, and then I shall have
a chance to get his skin and his feathers to put
on my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very soon he heard a noise in the air, but he
could see nothing. At length a large eagle dropped,
as if from the sky, on to the otter&rsquo;s carcass. Pauppukkeewis
drew his bow and sent an arrow through
the bird&rsquo;s body. The eagle made a dying effort
and lifted the carcass up several feet, but it could
not disengage its claws, and the weight soon brought
the bird down again.</p>

<p>Then Pauppukkeewis skinned the bird, crowned
his head with its feathers, and set out again on his
journey.</p>

<p>After walking a while he came to a lake, the
water of which came right up to the trees on its
banks. He soon saw that the lake had been made
by beavers. He took his station at a certain spot
to see whether any of the beavers would show
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
themselves. Soon he saw the head of one peeping out of
the water to see who the stranger was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Pauppukkeewis, &ldquo;could you not
turn me into a beaver like yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied the beaver; &ldquo;I will
go and ask the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon all the beavers showed their heads above
the water, and looked to see if Pauppukkeewis
was armed, but he had left his bow and arrows
in a hollow tree a short distance off. When they
were satisfied they all came near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you not, with all your united power,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;turn me into a beaver? I wish to live among
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the chief, &ldquo;lie down;&rdquo; and
Pauppukkeewis soon found himself changed into
one of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must make me large,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;larger
than any of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;by and by, when we get
into the lodge, it shall be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all dived into the lake, and Pauppukkeewis,
passing large heaps of limbs of trees and logs at
the bottom, asked the use of them. The beavers
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are our winter provisions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they all got into the lodge their number
was about one hundred. The lodge was large and
warm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we will make you large,&rdquo; said they, exerting
all their power. &ldquo;Will that do?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, for he found he was ten times
the size of the largest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not go out,&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;We will bring
your food into the lodge, and you shall be our chief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered Pauppukkeewis. He
thought&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will stay here and grow fat at their expense,&rdquo;
but very soon a beaver came into the lodge out of
breath, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are attacked by Indians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All huddled together in great fear. The water
began to lower, for the hunters had broken down the
dam, and soon the beavers heard them on the roof
of the lodge, breaking it in. Out jumped all the
beavers and so escaped. Pauppukkeewis tried to
follow them, but, alas! they had made him so large
that he could not creep out at the hole. He called to
them to come back, but none answered. He worried
himself so much in trying to escape that he looked
like a bladder. He could not change himself into a
man again though he heard and understood all the
hunters said. One of them put his head in at the
top of the lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ty-au!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Tut-ty-au! Me-shau-mik!
King of the beavers is in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they all got at Pauppukkeewis and battered
in his skull with their clubs. After that seven or
eight of them placed his body on poles and carried
him home. As he went he reflected&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will become of me? My ghost or shadow
will not die after they get me to their lodges.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
When the party arrived home, they sent out invitations
to a grand feast. The women took Pauppukkeewis
and laid him in the snow to skin him,
but as soon as his flesh got cold, his jee-bi, or spirit,
fled.</p>

<p>Pauppukkeewis found himself standing on a
prairie, having assumed his mortal shape. After
walking a short distance, he saw a herd of elks
feeding. He admired the apparent ease and enjoyment
of their life, and thought there could be nothing
more pleasant than to have the liberty of running
about, and feeding on the prairies. He asked them
if they could not change him into an elk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they answered, after a pause. &ldquo;Get down
on your hands and feet.&rdquo; He did so, and soon found
himself an elk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want big horns and big feet,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I wish
to be very large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; exerting all their
power, &ldquo;are you big enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, for he saw he was very large.</p>

<p>They spent a good time in playing and running.</p>

<p>Being rather cold one day he went into a thick
wood for shelter, and was followed by most of the
herd. They had not been there long before some
elks from behind passed them like a strong wind.
All took the alarm, and off they ran, Pauppukkeewis
with the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep out on the plains,&rdquo; said they, but he found
it was too late to do so, for they had already got
entangled in the thick woods. He soon smelt the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
hunters, who were closely following his trail, for they
had left all the others to follow him. He jumped
furiously, and broke down young trees in his flight,
but it only served to retard his progress. He soon
felt an arrow in his side. He jumped over trees
in his agony, but the arrows clattered thicker
and thicker about him, and at last one entered his
heart. He fell to the ground and heard the whoop
of triumph given by the warriors. On coming up
they looked at the carcass with astonishment, and,
with their hands up to their mouths, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ty-au! ty-au!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were about sixty in the party, who had
come out on a special hunt, for one of their number
had, the day before, observed Pauppukkeewis&rsquo;s large
tracks in the sand. They skinned him, and as his
flesh got cold his jee-bi took its flight, and once
more he found himself in human shape.</p>

<p>His passion for adventure was not yet cooled.
On coming to a large lake, the shore of which
was sandy, he saw a large flock of brant, and,
speaking to them, he asked them to turn him into
a brant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said they.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want to be very large,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied the brant, and he soon
found himself one of them, of prodigious size, all
the others looking on at him in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must fly as leader,&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Pauppukkeewis, &ldquo;I will fly behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;One thing we have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to say to you. You must be careful in flying not
to look down, for if you do something may happen
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said he, and soon the flock rose up
in the air, for they were bound for the north.
They flew very fast with Pauppukkeewis behind.
One day, while going with a strong wind, and as
swift as their wings would flap, while they passed
over a large village, the Indians below raised a
great shout, for they were amazed at the enormous
size of Pauppukkeewis. They made such a noise
that Pauppukkeewis forgot what had been told him
about not looking down. He was flying as swift as
an arrow, and as soon as he brought his neck in,
and stretched it down to look at the shouters, his
tail was caught by the wind, and he was blown over
and over. He tried to right himself, but without
success. Down he went from an immense height,
turning over and over. He lost his senses, and
when he recovered them he found himself jammed
in a cleft in a hollow tree. To get backward or forward
was impossible, and there he remained until
his brant life was ended by starvation. Then his
jee-bi again left the carcass, and once more he found
himself in human shape.</p>

<p>Travelling was still his passion, and one day he
came to a lodge, in which were two old men whose
heads were white from age. They treated him well,
and he told them he was going back to his village
to see his friends and people. The old men said
they would aid him, and pointed out the way they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
said he should go, but they were deceivers. After
walking all day he came to a lodge very like the
first, and looking in he found two old men with
white heads. It was in fact the very same lodge,
and he had been walking in a circle. The old men
did not undeceive him, but pretended to be strangers,
and said in a kind voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will show you the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After walking the third day, and coming back to
the same place, he discovered their trickery, for he
had cut a notch in the door-post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you,&rdquo; said he to them, &ldquo;to treat <i>me</i>
so?&rdquo; and he gave one a kick and the other a slap
that killed them. Their blood flew against the rocks
near their lodge, and that is the reason there are
red streaks in them to this day. Then Pauppukkeewis
burned their lodge.</p>

<p>He continued his journey, not knowing exactly
which way to go. At last he came to a big lake.
He ascended the highest hill to try and see the
opposite shore, but he could not, so he made a canoe
and took a sail on the water. On looking down he
saw that the bottom of the lake was covered with
dark fish, of which he caught some. This made him
wish to return to his village, and bring his people
to live near this lake. He sailed on, and towards
evening came to an island, where he stopped and ate
the fish.</p>

<p>Next day he returned to the mainland, and,
while wandering along the shore, he encountered
a more powerful manito than himself, named
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Manabozho. Pauppukkeewis thought it best, after playing
him a trick, to keep out of his way. He again
thought of returning to his village, and, transforming
himself into a partridge, took his flight towards
it. In a short time he reached it, and his return
was welcomed with feasting and songs. He told
them of the lake and of the fish, and, telling them
that it would be easier for them to live there, persuaded
them all to remove. He immediately began
to lead them by short journeys, and all things turned
out as he had said.</p>

<p>While the people lived there a messenger came
to Pauppukkeewis in the shape of a bear, and said
that the bear-chief wished to see him at once at
his village. Pauppukkeewis was ready in an instant,
and getting on the messenger&rsquo;s back was carried away.
Towards evening they ascended a high mountain,
and came to a cave, in which the bear-chief lived.
He was a very large creature, and he made Pauppukkeewis
welcome, inviting him into his lodge.</p>

<p>As soon as propriety allowed he spoke, and said
that he had sent for him because he had heard he was
the chief who was leading a large party towards his
hunting-grounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you have no
right there, and I wish you to leave the country
with your party, or else we must fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Pauppukkeewis, &ldquo;so be it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not wish to do anything without consulting
his people, and he saw that the bear-chief was raising
a war-party, so he said he would go back that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
night. The bear-king told him he might do as he
wished, and that one of the bears was at his command;
so Pauppukkeewis, jumping on its back,
rode home. Then he assembled the village, and told
the young men to kill the bear, make ready a feast,
and hang the head outside the village, for he knew
the bear spies would soon see it and carry the news
to their chief.</p>

<p>Next morning Pauppukkeewis got all his young
warriors ready for the fight. After waiting one day,
the bear war-party came in sight, making a tremendous
noise. The bear-chief advanced, and said that
he did not wish to shed the blood of the young
warriors, but if Pauppukkeewis would consent they
two would run a race, and the winner should kill
the losing chief, and all the loser&rsquo;s followers should
be the slaves of the other. Pauppukkeewis agreed,
and they ran before all the warriors. He was victor;
but not to terminate the race too quickly he gave
the bear-chief some specimens of his skill, forming
eddies and whirlwinds with the sand as he twisted
and turned about. As the bear-chief came to the
post Pauppukkeewis drove an arrow through him.
Having done this he told his young men to take
the bears and tie one at the door of each lodge, that
they might remain in future as slaves.</p>

<p>After seeing that all was quiet and prosperous in
the village, Pauppukkeewis felt his desire for adventure
returning, so he took an affectionate leave of
his friends and people, and started off again. After
wandering a long time, he came to the lodge of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Manabozho, who was absent. Pauppukkeewis thought
he would play him a trick, so he turned everything
in the lodge upside down and killed his chickens.
Now Manabozho calls all the fowl of the air his
chickens, and among the number was a raven, the
meanest of birds, and him Pauppukkeewis killed
and hung up by the neck to insult Manabozho. He
then went on till he came to a very high point of
rocks running out into the lake, from the top of
which he could see the country as far as eye could
reach. While he sat there, Manabozho&rsquo;s mountain
chickens flew round and past him in great numbers.
So, out of spite, he shot many of them, for his
arrows were sure and the birds many, and he amused
himself by throwing the birds down the precipice.
At length a wary bird called out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pauppukkeewis is killing us: go and tell our
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away flew some of them, and Manabozho soon
made his appearance on the plain below.</p>

<p>Pauppukkeewis slipped down the other side of the
mountain. Manabozho cried from the top&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The earth is not so large but I can get up to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off Pauppukkeewis ran and Manabozho after him.
He ran over hills and prairies with all his speed, but
his pursuer was still hard after him. Then he thought
of a shift. He stopped, and climbed a large pine-tree,
stripped it of all its green foliage, and threw it
to the winds. Then he ran on. When Manabozho
reached the tree, it called out to him&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
&ldquo;Great Manabozho, give me my life again. Pauppukkeewis
has killed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; said Manabozho, and it took him
some time to gather the scattered foliage. Then he
resumed the chase. Pauppukkeewis repeated the
same trick with the hemlock, and with other trees,
for Manabozho would always stop to restore anything
that called upon him to give it life again.
By this means Pauppukkeewis kept ahead, but still
Manabozho was overtaking him when Pauppukkeewis
saw an elk. He asked it to take him on its
back, and this the animal did, and for a time he
made great progress. Still Manabozho was in sight.
Pauppukkeewis dismounted, and, coming to a large
sandstone rock, he broke it in pieces, and scattered
the grains. Manabozho was so close upon him at
this place that he had almost caught him, but the
foundation of the rock cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haye! Ne-me-sho! Pauppukkeewis has spoiled
me. Will you not restore me to life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Manabozho, and he restored the
rock to its previous shape. He then pushed on in
pursuit of Pauppukkeewis, and had got so near as
to put out his arm to seize him, when Pauppukkeewis
dodged him, and raised such a dust and commotion
by whirlwinds, as to make the trees break,
and the sand and leaves dance in the air. Again
and again Manabozho&rsquo;s hand was put out to catch
him, but he dodged him at every turn, and at last,
making a great dust, he dashed into a hollow tree,
which had been blown down, and, changing himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
into a snake, crept out at its roots. Well that he did;
for at the moment Manabozho, who is Ogee-bau-ge-mon
(a species of lightning) struck the tree with all
his power, and shivered it to fragments. Pauppukkeewis
again took human shape, and again Manabozho,
pursuing him, pressed him hard.</p>

<p>At a distance Pauppukkeewis saw a very high rock
jutting out into a lake, and he ran for the foot of
the precipice, which was abrupt and elevated. As he
came near, the manito of the rock opened his door
and told him to come in. No sooner was the door
closed than Manabozho knocked at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open,&rdquo; he cried in a loud voice.</p>

<p>The manito was afraid of him, but said to his
guest&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I have sheltered you, I would sooner die
with you than open the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open,&rdquo; Manabozho cried again.</p>

<p>The manito was silent. Manabozho made no
attempt to force the door open. He waited a few
moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I give you till night to
live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The manito trembled, for he knew that when the
hour came he would be shut up under the earth.</p>

<p>Night came, the clouds hung low and black, and
every moment the forked lightning flashed from
them. The black clouds advanced slowly and threw
their dark shadows afar, and behind was heard the
rumbling noise of the coming thunder. When the
clouds were gathered over the rock the thunders
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
roared, the lightning flashed, the ground shook, and
the solid rock split, tottered, and fell. Under the
ruins lay crushed the mortal bodies of Pauppukkeewis
and the manito.</p>

<p>It was only then that Pauppukkeewis found that
he was really dead. He had been killed before in the
shapes of different animals, but now his body, in
human shape, was crushed.</p>

<p>Manabozho came and took his jee-bi, or spirit.
&ldquo;You,&rdquo; said he to Pauppukkeewis, &ldquo;shall not be again
permitted to live on the earth. I will give you the
shape of the war-eagle, and you shall be the chief of
all birds, and your duty shall be to watch over their
destinies.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE DISCOVERY OF THE UPPER WORLD.</h2>


<p>The Minnatarees, and all the other Indians who are
not of the stock of the grandfather of nations,
were once not of this upper air, but dwelt in the
bowels of the earth. The Good Spirit, when he
made them, meant, no doubt, at a proper time to
put them in enjoyment of all the good things which
he had prepared for them upon earth, but he ordered
that their first stage of existence should be within
it. They all dwelt underground, like moles, in one
great cavern. When they emerged it was in different
places, but generally near where they now inhabit.
At that time few of the Indian tribes wore the
human form. Some had the figures or semblances
of beasts. The Paukunnawkuts were rabbits, some
of the Delawares were ground-hogs, others tortoises,
and the Tuscaroras, and a great many others, were
rattlesnakes. The Sioux were the hissing-snakes,
but the Minnatarees were always men. Their part
of the great cavern was situated far towards the
mountains of snow.</p>

<p>The great cavern in which the Indians dwelt was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
indeed a dark and dismal region. In the country of
the Minnatarees it was lighted up only by the rays
of the sun which strayed through the fissures of the
rock and the crevices in the roof of the cavern, while
in that of the Mengwe all was dark and sunless.
The life of the Indians was a life of misery compared
with that they now enjoy, and it was endured only
because they were ignorant of a fairer or richer
world, or a better or happier state of being.</p>

<p>There were among the Minnatarees two boys,
who, from the hour of their birth, showed superior
wisdom, sagacity, and cunning. Even while they
were children they were wiser than their fathers.
They asked their parents whence the light came
which streamed through the fissures of the rock and
played along the sides of the cavern, and whence
and from what descended the roots of the great vine.
Their father could not tell them, and their mother
only laughed at the question, which appeared to her
very foolish. They asked the priest, but he could
not tell them; but he said he supposed the light
came from the eyes of some great wolf. The boys
asked the king tortoise, who sulkily drew his head
into his shell, and made no answer. When they
asked the chief rattlesnake, he answered that he
knew, and would tell them all about it if they would
promise to make peace with his tribe, and on no
account kill one of his descendants. The boys promised,
and the chief rattlesnake then told them that
there was a world above them, a beautiful world,
peopled by creatures in the shape of beasts, having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
a pure atmosphere and a soft sky, sweet fruits and
mellow water, well-stocked hunting-grounds and well-filled
lakes. He told them to ascend by the roots,
which were those of a great grape-vine. A while
after the boys were missing; nor did they come back
till the Minnatarees had celebrated their death, and
the lying priest had, as he falsely said, in a vision
seen them inhabitants of the land of spirits.</p>

<p>The Indians were surprised by the return of the
boys. They came back singing and dancing, and
were grown so much, and looked so different from
what they did when they left the cavern, that their
father and mother scarcely knew them. They were
sleek and fat, and when they walked it was with so
strong a step that the hollow space rang with the
sound of their feet. They were covered with the
skins of animals, and had blankets of the skins of
racoons and beavers. They described to the Indians
the pleasures of the upper world, and the people
were delighted with their story. At length they
resolved to leave their dull residence underground
for the upper regions. All agreed to this except
the ground-hog, the badger, and the mole, who said,
as they had been put where they were, they would
live and die there. The rabbit said he would live
sometimes above and sometimes below.</p>

<p>When the Indians had determined to leave their
habitations underground, the Minnatarees began,
men, women, and children, to clamber up the vine,
and one-half of them had already reached the surface
of the earth, when a dire mishap involved the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
remainder in a still more desolate captivity within
its bowels.</p>

<p>There was among them a very fat old woman,
who was heavier than any six of her nation. Nothing
would do but she must go up before some
of her neighbours. Away she clambered, but her
weight was so great that the vine broke with it,
and the opening, to which it afforded the sole means
of ascending, closed upon her and the rest of her
nation.</p>

<h2>THE BOY WHO SNARED THE SUN.</h2>


<p>At the time when the animals reigned on the earth
they had killed all but a girl and her little brother,
and these two were living in fear and seclusion.
The boy was a perfect pigmy, never growing beyond
the stature of a small infant, but the girl increased
with her years, so that the labour of providing food
and lodging devolved wholly on her. She went out
daily to get wood for their lodge fire, and took her
brother with her so that no accident might happen
to him, for he was too little to leave alone&mdash;a big
bird might have flown away with him. She made
him a bow and arrows, and said to him one winter
day&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will leave you behind where I have been
chopping; you must hide yourself, and you will see
the gitshee-gitshee-gaun ai see-ug, or snow-birds,
come and pick the worms out of the wood, where I
have been chopping. Shoot one of them and bring
it home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He obeyed her, and tried his best to kill one, but
came home unsuccessful. She told him he must not
despair, but try again the next day. She accordingly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
left him at the place where she got wood and
returned home. Towards nightfall she heard his
footsteps on the snow, and he came in exultingly,
and threw down one of the birds he had killed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I wish you to skin it and
stretch the skin, and when I have killed more I will
have a coat made out of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do with the body?&rdquo; asked she,
for as yet men had not begun to eat animal food,
but lived on vegetables alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut it in two,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and season our
pottage with one-half of it at a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did so. The boy continued his efforts, and
succeeded in killing ten birds, out of the skins of
which his sister made him a little coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said he one day, &ldquo;are we all alone in
the world? Is there nobody else living?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His sister told him that they two alone remained;
that the beings who had killed all their relations
lived in a certain quarter, and that he must by no
means go in that direction. This only served to
inflame his curiosity and raise his ambition, and he
soon after took his bow and arrows and went to seek
the beings of whom his sister had told him. After
walking a long time and meeting nothing he became
tired, and lay down on a knoll where the sun had
melted the snow. He fell fast asleep, and while
sleeping the sun beat so hot upon him that it singed
and drew up his birdskin coat, so that when he
awoke and stretched himself, he felt, as it were, bound
in it. He looked down and saw the damage done,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and then he flew into a passion, upbraided the sun,
and vowed vengeance against it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not think you are too high,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I
shall revenge myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On coming home he related his disaster to his
sister, and lamented bitterly the spoiling of his coat.
He would not eat. He lay down as one that fasts,
and did not stir or move his position for ten days,
though his sister did all she could to arouse him.
At the end of ten days he turned over, and then lay
ten days on the other side. Then he got up and
told his sister to make him a snare, for he meant to
catch the sun. At first she said she had nothing,
but finally she remembered a little piece of dried
deer&rsquo;s sinew that her father had left, and this she
soon made into a string suitable for a noose. The
moment, however, she showed it to her brother, he
told her it would not do, and bade her get something
else. She said she had nothing&mdash;nothing at all. At
last she thought of her hair, and pulling some of it
out made a string. Her brother again said it
would not answer, and bade her, pettishly, and with
authority, make him a noose. She replied that
there was nothing to make it of, and went out of
the lodge. When she was all alone she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neow obewy indapin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile her brother awaited her, and it was not
long before she reappeared with some tiny cord.
The moment he saw it he was delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; he cried, and he put the cord to
his mouth and began pulling it through his lips, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
as fast as he drew it changed to a red metal cord of
prodigious length, which he wound around his body
and shoulders. He then prepared himself, and set
out a little after midnight that he might catch the
sun before it rose. He fixed his snare on a spot just
where he thought the sun would appear; and sure
enough he caught it, so that it was held fast in the
cord and could not rise.</p>

<p>The animals who ruled the earth were immediately
put into a great commotion. They had no light.
They called a council to debate the matter, and to
appoint some one to go and cut the cord&mdash;a very
hazardous enterprise, for who dare go so near to the
sun as would be necessary? The dormouse, however,
undertook the task. At that time the dormouse
was the largest animal in the world; when it stood
up it looked like a mountain. It set out upon its
mission, and, when it got to the place where the sun
lay snared, its back began to smoke and burn, so
intense was the heat, and the top of its carcass was
reduced to enormous heaps of ashes. It succeeded,
however, in cutting the cord with its teeth and freed
the sun, but was reduced to a very small size, and
has remained so ever since. Men call it the Kug-e-been-gwa-kwa.</p>

<h2>THE MAID IN THE BOX.</h2>


<p>There once lived a woman called Monedo Kway
(female spirit or prophetess) on the sand mountains,
called The Sleeping Bear of Lake Michigan, who had
a daughter as beautiful as she was modest and
discreet. Everybody spoke of her beauty, and she
was so handsome that her mother feared she would
be carried off, so to prevent it she put her in a box,
which she pushed into the middle of the lake. The
box was tied by a long string to a stake on shore,
and every morning the mother pulled the box to
land, and, taking her daughter out of it, combed her
hair, gave her food, and then putting her again in
the box, set her afloat on the lake.</p>

<p>One day it chanced that a handsome young man
came to the spot at the moment the girl was being
thus attended to by her mother. He was struck
with her beauty, and immediately went home and
told his love to his uncle, who was a great chief and
a powerful magician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My nephew,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;go to the
mother&rsquo;s lodge and sit down in a modest manner
without saying a word. You need not ask her a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
question, for whatever you think she will understand,
and what she thinks in answer you will understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man did as he was bid. He entered
the woman&rsquo;s lodge and sat with his head bent down
in a thoughtful manner, without uttering a word.
He then thought&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish she would give me her daughter.&rdquo; Very
soon he understood the mother&rsquo;s thoughts in reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give you my daughter!&rdquo; thought she. &ldquo;You!
no, indeed! my daughter shall never marry you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man went away and reported the result
to his uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woman without good sense!&rdquo; exclaimed the old
man. &ldquo;Who is she keeping her daughter for? Does
she think she will marry the Mudjikewis (a term
indicating the heir or successor to the first in power)?
Proud heart! We will try her magic skill, and see
whether she can withstand our power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He forthwith set himself to work, and in a short
time the pride and haughtiness of the mother was
made known to all the spirits on that part of the
lake, and they met together and resolved to exert
their power to humble her. To do this they determined
to raise a great storm on the lake. The water
began to roar and toss, and the tempest became so
severe that the string holding the box broke, and it
floated off through the straits down Lake Huron,
and struck against the sandy shores at its outlet.
The place where it struck was near the lodge of a
decayed old magician called Ishkwon Daimeka, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the keeper of the gate of the lakes. He opened the
box and let out the beautiful daughter, whom he
took into his lodge and made his wife.</p>

<p>When her mother found that her daughter had
been carried off by the storm, she raised loud cries
and lamented exceedingly. This she continued to
do for a long time, and would not be comforted. At
last the spirits began to pity her, and determined to
raise another storm to bring the daughter back.
This was even a greater storm than the first. The
water of the lake washed away the ground, and
swept on to the lodge of Ishkwon Daimeka, whose
wife, when she saw the flood approaching, leaped
into the box, and the waves, carrying her off, landed
her at the very spot where was her mother&rsquo;s lodge.</p>

<p>Monedo Kway was overjoyed, but when she opened
the box she found her daughter, indeed, but her
beauty had almost all departed. However, she loved
her still, because she was her daughter, and now
thought of the young man who had come to seek
her in marriage. She sent a formal message to him,
but he had heard of all that had occurred, and his
love for the girl had died away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I marry your daughter!&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;Your
daughter! no, indeed! I shall never marry her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The storm that brought the girl back was so
strong that it tore away a large part of the shore of
the lake and swept off Ishkwon Daimeka&rsquo;s lodge,
the fragments of which, lodging in the straits, formed
those beautiful islands which are scattered in the
St. Clair and Detroit rivers. As to Ishkwon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Daimeka himself, he was drowned, and his bones
lie buried under the islands. As he was carried
away by the waves on a fragment of his lodge,
the old man was heard lamenting his fate in a
song.</p>

<h2>THE SPIRITS AND THE LOVERS.</h2>


<p>At the distance of a woman&rsquo;s walk of a day from
the mouth of the river, called by the pale-faces the
Whitestone, in the country of the Sioux, in the
middle of a large plain, stands a lofty hill or mound.
Its wonderful roundness, together with the circumstance
of its standing apart from all other hills, like
a fir-tree in the midst of a wide prairie, or a man
whose friends and kindred have all descended to the
dust, has made it known to all the tribes of the
West. Whether it was created by the Great Spirit
or filled up by the sons of men, whether it was done
in the morning of the world, ask not me, for I cannot
tell you. Know it is called by all the tribes of
the land the Hill of Little People, or the Mountain
of Little Spirits. No gifts can induce an Indian to
visit it; for why should he incur the anger of the
Little People who dwell in it, and, sacrificed upon
the fire of their wrath, behold his wife and children
no more? In all the marches and counter-marches
of the Indians, in all their goings and returnings,
in all their wanderings by day or by night to and
from lands which lie beyond it, their paths are so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
ordered that none approaches near enough to disturb
the tiny inhabitants of the hill. The memory of the
red-man of the forest has preserved but one instance
when their privacy was violated, since it was known
through the tribes that they wished for no intercourse
with mortals. Before that time many Indians
were missing each year. No one knew what became
of them, but they were gone, and left no trace nor
story behind. Valiant warriors filled their quivers
with arrows, put new strings to their bows, new shod
their moccasins, and sallied out to acquire glory in
combat; but there was no wailing in the camp of our
foes: their arrows were not felt, their shouts were
not heard. Yet they fell not by the hands of our
foes, but perished we know not how.</p>

<p>Many seasons ago there lived within the limits of
the great council-fire of the Mahas a chief who was
renowned for his valour and victories in the field,
his wisdom in the council, his dexterity and success
in the chase. His name was Mahtoree, or the White
Crane. He was celebrated throughout the vast
regions of the West, from the Mississippi to the
Hills of the Serpent, from the Missouri to the Plains
of Bitter Frost, for all those qualities which render
an Indian warrior famous and feared.</p>

<p>In one of the war expeditions of the Pawnee
Mahas against the Burntwood Tetons, it was the
good fortune of the former to overcome and to make
many prisoners&mdash;men, women, and children. One
of the captives, Sakeajah, or the Bird-Girl, a beautiful
creature in the morning of life, after being adopted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
into one of the Mahas families, became the wife of
the chief warrior of the nation. Great was the love
which the White Crane had for his wife, and it
grew yet stronger when she had brought him four
sons and a daughter, Tatokah, or the Antelope.
She was beautiful. Her skin was fair, her eyes were
large and bright as those of the bison-ox, and her
hair black, and braided with beads, brushed, as she
walked, the dew from the flowers upon the prairies.
Her temper was gentle and her voice sweet.</p>

<p>It may not be doubted that the beautiful Tatokah
had many lovers; but the heart of the maiden was
touched by none of the noble youths who sought
her. She bade them all depart as they came; she
rejected them all. With the perverseness which is
often seen among women, she had placed her affections
upon a youth who had distinguished himself
by no valiant deeds in war, nor by industry or dexterity
in the chase. His name had never reached
the surrounding nations. His own nation knew
him not, unless as a weak and imbecile man. He
was poor in everything which constitutes the riches
of Indian life. Who had heard the twanging of
Karkapaha&rsquo;s bow in the retreat of the bear, or who
had beheld the war-paint on his cheek or brow?
Where were the scalps or the prisoners that betokened
his valour or daring? No song of valiant
exploits had been heard from his lips, for he had
none to boast of&mdash;if he had done aught becoming a
man, he had done it when none was by. The
beautiful Tatokah, who knew and lamented the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
deficiencies of her lover, strove long to conquer her
passion without success. At length, since her father
would not agree to her union with her lover, the
two agreed to fly together. The night fixed came,
and they left the village of the Mahas and the lodge
of Mahtoree for the wilderness.</p>

<p>Their flight was not unmarked, and when the
father was made acquainted with the disgrace which
had befallen him, he called his young men around
him, and bade them pursue the fugitives, promising
his daughter to whomsoever should slay the Karkapaha.
Immediately pursuit was made, and soon a
hundred eager youths were on the track of the
hapless pair. With that unerring skill and sagacity
in discovering footprints which mark their race,
their steps were tracked, and themselves soon discovered
flying. What was the surprise of the pursuers
when they found that the path taken by the
hapless pair would carry them to the mountain of
little spirits, and that they were sufficiently in advance
to reach it before they could be overtaken.
None of them durst venture within the supposed
limits, and they halted till the White Crane should
be informed of his daughter and her lover having
placed themselves under the protection of the
spirits.</p>

<p>In the meantime the lovers pursued their journey
towards the fearful residence of the little people.
Despair lent them courage to perform an act to which
the stoutest Indian resolution had hitherto been
unequal. They determined to tell their tale to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
spirits and ask their protection. They were within
a few feet of the hill when, on a sudden, its brow,
on which no object had till now been visible,
became covered with little people, the tallest of
whom was not higher than the knee of the maiden,
while many of them&mdash;but these were children&mdash;were
of lower stature than the squirrel. Their voice was
sharp and quick, like the barking of the prairie dog.
A little wing came out at each shoulder; each had
a single eye, which eye was to the right in the men,
and to the left in the women, and their feet stood
out at each side. They were armed like Indians,
with tomahawks, spears, bows, and arrows. He
who appeared to be the head chief&mdash;for he wore an
air of command, and had the eagle feather&mdash;came up
to the fugitives and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have you invaded the village of our race
whose wrath has been so fatal to your people?
How dare you venture within the limits of our residence?
Know you not that your lives are forfeited?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tatokah, for her lover had less than the heart of a
doe and was speechless, related their story. She
told them how they had loved, how wroth her
father had been, how they had stolen away and
been pursued, and concluded her tale of sorrow with
a flood of tears. The little man who wore the eagle
feather appeared moved by what she said, and
calling around him a large number of men, who
were doubtless the chiefs and counsellors of the
nation, a long consultation took place. The result
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
was a determination to favour and protect the
lovers.</p>

<p>At this moment Shongotongo, or the Big Horse,
one of the braves whom Mahtoree had despatched
in quest of his daughter, appeared in view in pursuit
of the fugitives. It was not till Mahtoree had
taxed his courage that Big Horse had ventured on
the perilous quest. He approached with the
strength of heart and singleness of purpose which
accompany an Indian warrior who deems the eyes
of his nation upon him. When first the brave was
discovered thus wantonly, and with no other purpose
but the shedding of blood, intruding on the
dominions of the spirits, no words can tell the rage
which appeared to possess their bosoms. Secure in
the knowledge of their power to repel the attacks
of every living thing, the intrepid Maha was permitted
to advance within a few steps of Karkapaha.
He had just raised his spear to strike the unmanly
lover, when, all at once, he found himself riveted to
the ground. His feet refused to move, his hands
hung powerless at his side, his tongue refused
to utter a word. The bow and arrow fell from
his hand, and his spear lay powerless. A little
child, not so high as the fourth leaf of the thistle,
came and spat on him, and a company of the spirits
danced around him singing a taunting song. When
they had thus finished their task of preparatory
torture, a thousand little spirits drew their bows,
and a thousand arrows pierced his heart. In a
moment innumerable mattocks were employed in
preparing him a grave, and he was hidden from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
eyes of the living ere Tatokah could have thrice
counted over the fingers of her hand.</p>

<p>When this was done, the chief of the little spirits
called Karkapaha before him, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maha, you have the heart of a doe. You would
fly from a roused wren. We have not spared you
because you deserve to be spared, but because the
maiden loves you. It is for this purpose that we
will give you the heart of a man, that you may
return to the village of the Mahas, and find favour
in the eyes of Mahtoree and the braves of the
nation. We will take away your cowardly spirit,
and will give you the spirit of the warrior whom we
slew, whose heart was firm as a rock. Sleep, man
of little soul, and wake to be better worthy the love
of the beautiful Antelope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a deep sleep came over the Maha lover.
How long he slept he knew not, but when he woke
he felt at once that a change had taken place in his
feelings and temper. The first thought that came
to his mind was of a bow and arrow, the second was
of the beautiful maiden who lay sleeping at his side.
The little spirits had disappeared&mdash;not a solitary
being of the many thousands who, but a few
minutes before, had filled the air with their discordant
cries was now to be seen or heard. At the
feet of Karkapaha lay a tremendous bow, larger
than any warrior ever yet used, a sheaf of arrows of
proportionate size, and a spear of a weight which no
Maha could wield. Karkapaha drew the bow as an
Indian boy bends a willow twig, and the spear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
seemed in his hand but a reed or a feather. The
shrill war-whoop burst unconsciously from his lips,
and his nostrils seemed dilated with the fire and
impatience of a newly-awakened courage. The
heart of the fond Indian girl dissolved in tears when
she saw these proofs of strength and these evidences
of spirit which, she knew, if they were coupled with
valour&mdash;and how could she doubt the completeness
of the gift to effect the purposes of the giver?&mdash;would
thaw the iced feelings of her father and tune
his heart to the song of forgiveness. Yet it was not
without many fears, tears, and misgivings on the
part of the maiden that they began their journey to
the Mahas village. The lover, now a stranger to
fear, used his endeavours to quiet the beautiful
Tatokah, and in some measure succeeded. Upon
finding that his daughter and her lover had gone to
the Hill of the Spirits, and that Shongotongo did
not return from his perilous adventure, the chief of
the Mahas had recalled his braves from the pursuit,
and was listening to the history of the pair, as far as
the returned warriors were acquainted with it, when
his daughter and her lover made their appearance.
With a bold and fearless step the once faint-hearted
Karkapaha walked up to the offended father, and,
folding his arms upon his breast, stood erect as a
pine, and motionless as that tree when the winds of
the earth are chained. It was the first time that
Karkapaha had ever looked on angry men without
trembling, and a demeanour so unusual in him
excited universal surprise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
&ldquo;Karkapaha is a thief,&rdquo; said the White Crane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the father of Tatokah that says it,&rdquo; answered
the lover, &ldquo;else would Karkapaha say it was the
song of a bird that has flown over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My warriors say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your warriors are singing-birds; they are wrens.
Karkapaha says they do not speak the truth. Karkapaha
has a brave heart and the strength of a bear.
Let the braves try him. He has thrown away the
woman&rsquo;s heart, and become a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Karkapaha is changed,&rdquo; said the chief thoughtfully,
&ldquo;but how and when?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Little Spirits of the mountain have given
him a new soul. Bid your braves draw this bow.
Bid them poise this spear. Their eyes say they can
do neither. Then is Karkapaha the strong man of
his tribe?&rdquo; As he said this he flourished the ponderous
spear over his head as a man would poise a
reed, and drew the bow as a child would bend a
twig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Karkapaha is the husband of Tatokah,&rdquo; said
Mahtoree, springing to his feet, and he gave the
maiden to her lover.</p>

<p>The traditionary lore of the Mahas is full of the
exploits, both in war and in the chase, of Karkapaha,
who was made a man by the Spirits of the Mountain.</p>

<h2>THE WONDERFUL ROD.</h2>


<p>The Choctaws had for many years found a home in
regions beyond the Mountains of Snow, far away to
the west of the Mississippi. They, however, decided,
for some reason or other, to leave the place in which
they dwelt, and the question then arose in what
direction they should journey. Now, there was a
jossakeed (priest) who had a wonderful rod, and
he said that he would lead them.</p>

<p>For many years, therefore, they travelled, being
guided by him. He walked before them bearing
the rod, and when night was come he put it upright
in the earth, and the people encamped round it. In
the morning they looked to see in what direction
the rod pointed, for each night the rod left its
upright position, and inclined one way or another.
Day after day the rod was found pointing to the
east, and thither the Choctaws accordingly bent
their steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must travel,&rdquo; said the jossakeed, &ldquo;as long
as the rod directs you pointing to the direction in
which you must go, but when the rod ceases to
point, and stands upright, then you must live
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
So the people went on until they came to a hill,
where they camped, having first put up the rod so
that it did not lean at all. In the morning, when
they went to see which direction the rod pointed
out for them to take, they found it upright, and
from it there grew branches bearing green leaves.
Then they said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will stop here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So that became the centre of the land of the
Choctaws.</p>

<h2>THE FUNERAL FIRE.</h2>


<p>For several nights after the interment of a Chippewa
a fire is kept burning upon the grave. This
fire is lit in the evening, and carefully supplied with
small sticks of dry wood, to keep up a bright but
small fire. It is kept burning for several hours,
generally until the usual hour of retiring to rest, and
then suffered to go out. The fire is renewed for four
nights, and sometimes for longer. The person who
performs this pious office is generally a near relative
of the deceased, or one who has been long intimate
with him. The following tale is related as showing
the origin of the custom.</p>

<p>A small war party of Chippewas encountered
their enemies upon an open plain, where a severe
battle was fought. Their leader was a brave and
distinguished warrior, but he never acted with
greater bravery, or more distinguished himself by
personal prowess, than on this occasion. After turning
the tide of battle against his enemies, while
shouting for victory, he received an arrow in his
breast, and fell upon the plain. No warrior thus
killed is ever buried, and according to ancient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
custom, the chief was placed in a sitting posture
upon the field, his back supported by a tree, and
his face turned towards the direction in which his
enemies had fled. His headdress and equipment
were accurately adjusted as if he were living, and
his bow leaned against his shoulder. In this posture
his companions left him. That he was dead appeared
evident to all, but a strange thing had happened.
Although deprived of speech and motion,
the chief heard distinctly all that was said by his
friends. He heard them lament his death without
having the power to contradict it, and he felt their
touch as they adjusted his posture, without having
the power to reciprocate it. His anguish, when he
felt himself thus abandoned, was extreme, and his
wish to follow his friends on their return home so
completely filled his mind, as he saw them one after
another take leave of him and depart, that with a
terrible effort he arose and followed them. His
form, however, was invisible to them, and this aroused
in him surprise, disappointment, and rage, which by
turns took possession of him. He followed their
track, however, with great diligence. Wherever
they went he went, when they walked he walked,
when they ran he ran, when they encamped he
stopped with them, when they slept he slept, when
they awoke he awoke. In short, he mingled in all
their labours and toils, but he was excluded from all
their sources of refreshment, except that of sleeping,
and from the pleasures of participating in their conversation,
for all that he said received no notice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that you do not see
me, that you do not hear me, that you do not understand
me? Will you suffer me to bleed to death
without offering to stanch my wounds? Will you
permit me to starve while you eat around me? Have
those whom I have so often led to war so soon forgotten
me? Is there no one who recollects me, or
who will offer me a morsel of food in my distress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus he continued to upbraid his friends at every
stage of the journey, but no one seemed to hear his
words. If his voice was heard at all, it was mistaken
for the rustling of the leaves in the wind.</p>

<p>At length the returning party reached their village,
and their women and children came out, according
to custom, to welcome their return and proclaim
their praises.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kumaudjeewug! Kumaudjeewug! Kumaudjeewug!
they have met, fought, and conquered!&rdquo; was
shouted by every mouth, and the words resounded
through the most distant parts of the village. Those
who had lost friends came eagerly to inquire their
fate, and to know whether they had died like men.
The aged father consoled himself for the loss of his
son with the reflection that he had fallen manfully,
and the widow half forgot her sorrow amid the
praises that were uttered of the bravery of her husband.
The hearts of the youths glowed with martial
ardour as they heard these flattering praises, and
the children joined in the shouts, of which they
scarcely knew the meaning. Amidst all this uproar
and bustle no one seemed conscious of the presence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of the warrior-chief. He heard many inquiries made
respecting his fate. He heard his companions tell
how he had fought, conquered, and fallen, pierced
by an arrow through his breast, and how he had
been left behind among the slain on the field of
battle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not true,&rdquo; declared the angry chief, &ldquo;that
I was killed and left upon the field! I am here. I
live; I move; see me; touch me. I shall again
raise my spear in battle, and take my place in the
feast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody, however, seemed conscious of his presence,
and his voice was mistaken for the whispering
of the wind.</p>

<p>He now walked to his own lodge, and there he
found his wife tearing her hair and lamenting over
his fate. He endeavoured to undeceive her, but she,
like the others, appeared to be insensible of his presence,
and not to hear his voice. She sat in a
despairing manner, with her head reclining on her
hands. The chief asked her to bind up his wounds,
but she made no reply. He placed his mouth close
to her ear and shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am hungry, give me some food!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wife thought she heard a buzzing in her ear,
and remarked it to one who sat by. The enraged
husband now summoning all his strength, struck her
a blow on the forehead. His wife raised her hand to
her head, and said to her friend&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel a slight shooting pain in my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Foiled thus in every attempt to make himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
known, the warrior-chief began to reflect upon what
he had heard in his youth, to the effect that the
spirit was sometimes permitted to leave the body
and wander about. He concluded that possibly his
body might have remained upon the field of battle,
while his spirit only accompanied his returning
friends. He determined to return to the field,
although it was four days&rsquo; journey away. He accordingly
set out upon his way. For three days he
pursued his way without meeting anything uncommon;
but on the fourth, towards evening, as he
came to the skirts of the battlefield, he saw a fire in
the path before him. He walked to one side to
avoid stepping into it, but the fire also changed its
position, and was still before him. He then went
in another direction, but the mysterious fire still
crossed his path, and seemed to bar his entrance to
the scene of the conflict. In short, whichever way
he took, the fire was still before him,&mdash;no expedient
seemed to avail him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou demon!&rdquo; he exclaimed at length, &ldquo;why
dost thou bar my approach to the field of battle?
Knowest thou not that I am a spirit also, and that I
seek again to enter my body? Dost thou presume
that I shall return without effecting my object?
Know that I have never been defeated by the
enemies of my nation, and will not be defeated by
thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he made a sudden effort and jumped
through the flame. No sooner had he done so than
he found himself sitting on the ground, with his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
back supported by a tree, his bow leaning against
his shoulder, all his warlike dress and arms upon
his body, just as they had been left by his friends
on the day of battle. Looking up he beheld a large
canicu, or war eagle, sitting in the tree above his
head. He immediately recognised this bird to be
the same as he had once dreamt of in his youth&mdash;the
one he had chosen as his guardian spirit, or personal
manito. This eagle had carefully watched
his body and prevented other ravenous birds from
touching it.</p>

<p>The chief got up and stood upon his feet, but he
felt himself weak and much exhausted. The blood
upon his wound had stanched itself, and he now
bound it up. He possessed a knowledge of such
roots as have healing properties, and these he carefully
sought in the woods. Having found some, he
pounded some of them between stones and applied
them externally. Others he chewed and swallowed.
In a short time he found himself so much recovered
as to be able to commence his journey, but he suffered
greatly from hunger, not seeing any large
animals that he might kill. However, he succeeded
in killing some small birds with his bow and arrow,
and these he roasted before a fire at night.</p>

<p>In this way he sustained himself until he came
to a river that separated his wife and friends from
him. He stood upon the bank and gave that peculiar
whoop which is a signal of the return of a friend.
The sound was immediately heard, and a canoe was
despatched to bring him over, and in a short time,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
amidst the shouts of his friends and relations, who
thronged from every side to see the arrival, the
warrior-chief was landed.</p>

<p>When the first wild bursts of wonder and joy had
subsided, and some degree of quiet had been restored
to the village, he related to his people the
account of his adventures. He concluded his narrative
by telling them that it is pleasing to the spirit
of a deceased person to have a fire built upon the
grave for four nights after his burial; that it is four
days&rsquo; journey to the land appointed for the residence
of the spirits; that in its journey thither the spirit
stands in need of a fire every night at the place of
its encampment; and that if the friends kindle this
fire upon the spot where the body is laid, the spirit
has the benefit of its light and warmth on its path,
while if the friends neglect to do this, the spirit is
subjected to the irksome task of making its own fire
each night.</p>

<h2>THE LEGEND OF O-NA-WUT-A-QUT-O.</h2>


<p>A long time ago there lived an aged Odjibwa and
his wife on the shores of Lake Huron. They had
an only son, a very beautiful boy, named O-na-wut-a-qut-o,
or He that catches the clouds. The family
were of the totem of the beaver. The parents were
very proud of their son, and wished to make him a
celebrated man; but when he reached the proper
age he would not submit to the We-koon-de-win, or
fast. When this time arrived they gave him charcoal
instead of his breakfast, but he would not
blacken his face. If they denied him food he sought
bird&rsquo;s eggs along the shore, or picked up the heads
of fish that had been cast away, and broiled them.
One day they took away violently the food he had
prepared, and cast him some coals in place of it.
This act decided him. He took the coals and blackened
his face and went out of the lodge. He did
not return, but lay down without to sleep. As he
lay, a very beautiful girl came down from the clouds
and stood by his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-na-wut-a-qut-o,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am come for you.
Follow in my footsteps.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
The young man rose and did as he was bid. Presently
he found himself ascending above the tops of
the trees, and gradually he mounted up step by step
into the air, and through the clouds. At length
his guide led him through an opening, and he found
himself standing with her on a beautiful plain.</p>

<p>A path led to a splendid lodge, into which O-na-wut-a-qut-o
followed his guide. It was large, and
divided into two parts. At one end he saw bows
and arrows, clubs and spears, and various warlike
instruments tipped with silver. At the other end
were things exclusively belonging to women. This
was the house of his fair guide, and he saw that she
had on a frame a broad rich belt of many colours
that she was weaving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother is coming,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I must
hide you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting him in one corner she spread the belt over
him, and presently the brother came in very richly
dressed, and shining as if he had points of silver all
over him. He took down from the wall a splendid
pipe, and a bag in which was a-pa-ko-ze-gun, or
smoking mixture. When he had finished smoking,
he laid his pipe aside, and said to his sister&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nemissa,&rdquo; (elder sister) &ldquo;when will you quit these
practices? Do you forget that the greatest of the
spirits has commanded that you shall not take away
the children from below? Perhaps you think you
have concealed O-na-wut-a-qut-o, but do I not know
of his coming? If you would not offend me, send
him back at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
These words did not, however, alter his sister&rsquo;s
purpose. She would not send him back, and her
brother, finding that she was determined, called O-na-wut-a-qut-o
from his hiding-place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out of your concealment,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
walk about and amuse yourself. You will grow
hungry if you remain there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words O-na-wut-a-qut-o came forth from
under the belt, and the brother presented a bow and
arrows, with a pipe of red stone, richly ornamented,
to him. In this way he gave his consent to O-na-wut-a-qut-o&rsquo;s
marriage with his sister, and from that
time the youth and the girl became husband and
wife.</p>

<p>O-na-wut-a-qut-o found everything exceedingly
fair and beautiful around him, but he found no other
people besides his wife and her brother. There were
flowers on the plains, there were bright and sparkling
streams, there were green valleys and pleasant
trees, there were gay birds and beautiful animals,
very different from those he had been accustomed
to. There was also day and night as on the earth,
but he observed that every morning the brother
regularly left the lodge and remained absent all day,
and every evening his sister departed, but generally
for only a part of the night.</p>

<p>O-na-wut-a-qut-o was curious to solve this mystery,
and obtained the brother&rsquo;s consent to accompany
him in one of his daily journeys. They
travelled over a smooth plain which seemed to
stretch to illimitable distances all around. At
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
length O-na-wut-a-qut-o felt the gnawings of hunger
and asked his companion if there was no game
about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Patience, my brother,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;we shall
soon reach the spot where I eat my dinner, and you
will then see how I am provided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After walking on a long time they came to a place
where several fine mats were spread, and there they
sat down to refresh themselves. At this place there
was a hole in the sky and O-na-wut-a-qut-o, at his
companion&rsquo;s request, looked through it down upon
the earth. He saw below the great lakes and the
villages of the Indians. In one place he saw a war-party
stealing on the camp of their enemies. In
another he saw feasting and dancing. On a green
plain some young men were playing at ball, and
along the banks of a stream were women employed
in gathering the a-puk-wa for mats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see,&rdquo; asked the brother, &ldquo;that group of
children playing beside a lodge? Observe that
beautiful and active lad,&rdquo; said he, at the same time
darting something from his hand. The child immediately
fell on the ground, and was carried by his
companions into the lodge.</p>

<p>O-na-wut-a-qut-o and his companion watched and
saw the people below gathering about the lodge.
They listened to the she-she-gwau of the meeta, to
the song he sang asking that the child&rsquo;s life might
be spared. To this request O-na-wut-a-qut-o&rsquo;s companion
made answer&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send me up the sacrifice of a white dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
A feast was immediately ordered by the parents
of the child. The white dog was killed, his carcass
was roasted, all the wise men and medicine-men of
the village assembling to witness the ceremony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many below,&rdquo; said O-na-wut-a-qut-o&rsquo;s
companion, &ldquo;whom you call great in medical skill.
They are so, because their ears are open; and they
are able to succeed, because when I call they hear
my voice. When I have struck one with sickness
they direct the people to look to me, and when they
make me the offering I ask, I remove my hand from
off the sick person and he becomes well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While he was saying this, the feast below had
been served. Then the master of the feast said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We send this to thee, Great Manito,&rdquo; and immediately
the roasted animal came up. Thus O-na-wut-a-qut-o
and his companion got their dinner, and
after they had eaten they returned to the lodge by
a different path.</p>

<p>In this manner they lived for some time, but at
last the youth got weary of the life. He thought of
his friends, and wished to go back to them. He
could not forget his native village and his father&rsquo;s
lodge, and he asked his wife&rsquo;s permission to return.
After some persuasion she consented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you are better pleased,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with
the cares and ills and poverty of the world, than
with the peaceful delights of the sky and its boundless
prairies, go. I give you my permission, and
since I have brought you hither I will conduct you
back. Remember, however, that you are still my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
husband. I hold a chain in my hand by which I
can, whenever I will, draw you back to me. My
power over you will be in no way diminished. Beware,
therefore, how you venture to take a wife
among the people below. Should you ever do so,
you will feel what a grievous thing it is to arouse
my anger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she uttered these words her eyes sparkled, and
she drew herself up with a majestic air. In the
same moment O-na-wut-a-qut-o awoke. He found
himself on the ground near his father&rsquo;s lodge, on the
very spot where he had thrown himself down to
sleep. Instead of the brighter beings of a higher
world, he found around him his parents and their
friends. His mother told him that he had been
absent a year. For some time O-na-wut-a-qut-o
remained gloomy and silent, but by degrees he
recovered his spirits, and he began to doubt the
reality of all he had seen and heard above. At last
he even ventured to marry a beautiful girl of his
own tribe. But within four days she died. Still
he was forgetful of his first wife&rsquo;s command, and he
married again. Then one night he left his lodge, to
which he never returned. His wife, it is believed,
recalled him to the sky, where he still dwells, walking
the vast plains.</p>

<h2>MANABOZHO IN THE FISH&rsquo;S STOMACH.</h2>


<p>One day Manabozho said to his grandmother&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noko, get cedar bark and make me a line whilst
I make a canoe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When all was ready he went out to the middle of
the lake a-fishing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me-she-nah-ma-gwai (king-fish),&rdquo; said he, letting
down his line, &ldquo;take hold of my bait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kept repeating these words some time; at last
the king-fish said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a trouble Manabozho is! Here, trout, take
hold of his line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trout did as he was bid, and Manabozho drew
up his line, the trout&rsquo;s weight being so great that the
canoe was nearly overturned. Till he saw the trout
Manabozho kept crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha-ee-he! wha-ee-he!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as he saw him he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you take hold of my hook? Esa, esa!
shame, shame! you ugly fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trout, being thus rebuked, let go.</p>

<p>Manabozho let down his line again into the water,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
&ldquo;King-fish, take hold of my line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a trouble Manabozho is!&rdquo; cried the king-fish.
&ldquo;Sun-fish, take hold of his line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun-fish did as he was bid, and Manabozho
drew him up, crying as he did so&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha-ee-he! wha-ee-he!&rdquo; while the canoe turned
in swift circles.</p>

<p>When he saw the sun-fish, he cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Esa, esa! you odious fish! why did you dirty
my hook by taking it in your mouth? Let go, I say,
let go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun-fish did as he was bid, and on his return
to the bottom of the lake told the king-fish what
Manabozho had said. Just then the bait was let
down again near to the king, and Manabozho was
heard crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me-she-nah-ma-gwai, take hold of my hook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king-fish did so, and allowed himself to be
dragged to the surface, which he had no sooner
reached than he swallowed Manabozho and his canoe
at one gulp. When Manabozho came to himself he
found he was in his canoe in the fish&rsquo;s stomach. He
now began to think how he should escape. Looking
about him, he saw his war-club in his canoe, and with
it he immediately struck the heart of the fish. Then
he felt as though the fish was moving with great
velocity. The king-fish observed to his friends&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel very unwell for having swallowed that
nasty fellow Manabozho.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment he received another more severe
blow on the heart. Manabozho thought, &ldquo;If I am
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
thrown up in the middle of the lake I shall be
drowned, so I must prevent it.&rdquo; So he drew his
canoe and placed it across the fish&rsquo;s throat, and just
as he had finished doing this the king-fish tried to
cast him out.</p>

<p>Manabozho now found that he had a companion
with him. This was a squirrel that had been in his
canoe. The squirrel helped him to place the canoe
in the proper position, and Manabozho, being grateful
to it, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the future you shall be called Ajidanneo
(animal tail).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he recommenced his attack on the king-fish&rsquo;s
heart, and by repeated blows he at last succeeded in
killing him. He could tell that he had effected this
by the stoppage of the fish&rsquo;s motion, and he could
also hear the body beating against the shore.
Manabozho waited a day to see what would happen.
Then he heard birds scratching on the body, and all
at once the rays of light broke in. He could now
see the heads of the gulls, which were looking in at
the opening they had made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Manabozho, &ldquo;my younger brothers,
make the opening larger, so that I can get out.&rdquo; The
gulls then told one another that Manabozho was
inside the fish, and, setting to work at once to enlarge
the hole, they, in a short time, set him free. After
he got out Manabozho said to the gulls&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the future you shall be called Kayoshk
(noble scratchers), for your kindness to me.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE SUN AND THE MOON.</h2>


<p>There were once ten brothers who hunted together,
and at night they occupied the same lodge. One
day, after they had been hunting, coming home they
found sitting inside the lodge near the door a
beautiful woman. She appeared to be a stranger,
and was so lovely that all the hunters loved her, and
as she could only be the wife of one, they agreed that
he should have her who was most successful in the
next day&rsquo;s hunt. Accordingly, the next day, they
each took different ways, and hunted till the sun
went down, when they met at the lodge. Nine of
the hunters had found nothing, but the youngest
brought home a deer, so the woman was given to
him for his wife.</p>

<p>The hunter had not been married more than a
year when he was seized with sickness and died.
Then the next brother took the girl for his wife.
Shortly after he died also, and the woman married
the next brother. In a short time all the brothers
died save the eldest, and he married the girl. She
did not, however, love him, for he was of a churlish
disposition, and one day it came into the woman&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
head that she would leave him and see what fortune
she would meet with in the world. So she went,
taking only a dog with her, and travelled all day.
She went on and on, but towards evening she heard
some one coming after her who, she imagined, must
be her husband. In great fear she knew not which
way to turn, when she perceived a hole in the ground
before her. There she thought she might hide
herself, and entering it with her dog she suddenly
found herself going lower and lower, until she passed
through the earth and came up on the other side.
Near to her there was a lake, and a man fishing in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My grandfather,&rdquo; cried the woman, &ldquo;I am pursued
by a spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me,&rdquo; cried Manabozho, for it was he,
&ldquo;leave me. Let me be quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman still begged him to protect her, and
Manabozho at length said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go that way, and you shall be safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had she disappeared when the husband,
who had discovered the hole by which his wife had
descended, came on the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said he to Manabozho, &ldquo;where has the
woman gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me,&rdquo; cried Manabozho, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t trouble me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;where is the woman?&rdquo;
Manabozho was silent, and the husband, at last
getting angry, abused him with all his might.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman went that way,&rdquo; said Manabozho at
last. &ldquo;Run after her, but you shall never catch
her, and you shall be called Gizhigooke (day sun),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and the woman shall be called Tibikgizis (night
sun).&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the man went on running after his wife to the
west, but he has never caught her, and he pursues
her to this day.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE SNAIL AND THE BEAVER.</h2>


<p>The father of the Osage nation was a snail. It was
when the earth was young and little. It was before
the rivers had become wide or long, or the mountains
lifted their peaks above the clouds, that the snail
found himself passing a quiet existence on the banks
of the River Missouri. His wants and wishes were
but few, and well supplied, and he was happy.</p>

<p>At length the region of the Missouri was visited by
one of those great storms which so often scatter desolation
over it, and the river, swollen by the melted snow
and ice from the mountains, swept away everything
from its banks, and among other things the drowsy
snail. Upon a log he drifted down many a day&rsquo;s
journey, till the river, subsiding, left him and his log
upon the banks of the River of Fish. He was left in
the slime, and the hot sun beamed fiercely upon him
till he became baked to the earth and found himself
incapable of moving. Gradually he grew in size and
stature, and his form experienced a new change, till
at length what was once a snail creeping on the earth
ripened into man, erect, tall, and stately. For a
long time after his change to a human being he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
remained stupefied, not knowing what he was or by
what means to sustain life. At length recollection
returned to him. He remembered that he was once
a snail and dwelt upon another river. He became
animated with a wish to return to his old haunts,
and accordingly directed his steps towards those parts
from which he had been removed. Hunger now
began to prey upon him, and bade fair to close his
eyes before he should again behold his beloved haunts
on the banks of the river. The beasts of the forest
were many, but their speed outstripped his. The
birds of the air fluttered upon sprays beyond his
reach, and the fish gliding through the waves at his
feet were nimbler than he and eluded his grasp.
Each moment he grew weaker, the films gathered
before his eyes, and in his ears there rang sounds
like the whistling of winds through the woods in
the month before the snows. At length, wearied and
exhausted, he laid himself down upon a grassy bank.</p>

<p>As he lay the Great Spirit appeared to him and
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does he who is the kernel of the snail look
terrified, and why is he faint and weary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I tremble,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;is because I fear
thy power. That I faint is because I lack food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As regards thy trembling,&rdquo; answered the Great
Spirit, &ldquo;be composed. Art thou hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have eaten nothing,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;since
I ceased to be a snail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon hearing this the Great Spirit drew from
under his robe a bow and arrow, and bade the man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
observe what he did with it. On the topmost bough
of a lofty tree sat a beautiful bird, singing and
fluttering among the red leaves. He placed an arrow
on the bow, and, letting fly, the bird fell down upon
the earth. A deer was seen afar off browsing.
Again the archer bent his bow and the animal lay
dead, food for the son of the snail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are victuals for you,&rdquo; said the Spirit,
&ldquo;enough to last you till your strength enables you
to beat up the haunts of the deer and the moose,
and here is the bow and arrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Great Spirit also taught the man how to skin
the deer, and clothed him with the skin. Having
done this, and having given the beasts, fishes,
and all feathered creatures to him for his food and
raiment, he bade the man farewell and took his
departure.</p>

<p>Strengthened and invigorated, the man pursued
his journey towards the old spot. He soon stood
upon the banks of his beloved river. A few more
suns and he would sit down upon the very spot
where for so many seasons he had crawled on the
slimy leaf, so often dragged himself lazily over the
muddy pool. He had seated himself upon the bank
of the river, and was meditating deeply on these
things, when up crept from the water a beaver, who,
addressing him, said in an angry tone&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a snail,&rdquo; replied the Snail-Man. &ldquo;Who
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am head warrior of the nation of beavers,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
answered the other. &ldquo;By what authority have you
come to disturb my possession of this river, which
is my dominion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not your river,&rdquo; replied the Wasbasha.
&ldquo;The Great Being, who is over man and beast, has
given it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beaver was at first incredulous; but at length,
convinced that what the man said was true, he invited
him to accompany him to his home. The
man agreed, and went with him till they came to a
number of small cabins, into the largest of which
the beaver conducted him. He invited the man to
take food with him, and while the beaver&rsquo;s wife and
daughter were preparing the feast, he entertained
his guest with an account of his people&rsquo;s habits of
life. Soon the wife and daughter made their appearance
with the food, and sitting down the Snail-Man
was soon at his ease amongst them. He was
not, however, so occupied with the banquet that he
had not time to be enchanted with the beauty of
the beaver&rsquo;s daughter; and when the visit was
drawing to a close, so much was he in love, that he
asked the beaver to give her to him for his wife. The
beaver-chief consented, and the marriage was celebrated
by a feast, to which all the beavers, and the
animals with whom they had friendly relations,
were invited. From this union of the Snail-Man
and the Beaver-Maid sprang the tribe of the
Osages,&mdash;at least so it is related by the old men of
the tribe.</p>

<h2>THE STRANGE GUESTS.</h2>


<p>Many years ago there lived, near the borders of
Lake Superior, a noted hunter, who had a wife and
one child. His lodge stood in a remote part of the
forest, several days&rsquo; journey from that of any other
person. He spent his days in hunting, and his
evenings in relating to his wife the incidents that
had befallen him in the chase. As game was very
abundant, he seldom failed to bring home in the
evening an ample store of meat to last them until
the succeeding evening; and while they were seated
by the fire in his lodge partaking the fruits of his
day&rsquo;s labour, he entertained his wife with conversation,
or by occasionally relating those tales, or enforcing
those precepts, which every good Indian
esteems necessary for the instruction of his wife
and children. Thus, far removed from all sources
of disquiet, surrounded by all they deemed necessary
to their comfort, and happy in one another&rsquo;s
society, their lives passed away in cheerful solitude
and sweet contentment. The breast of the hunter
had never felt the compunctions of remorse, for he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
was a just man in all his dealings. He had never
violated the laws of his tribe by encroaching upon
the hunting-grounds of his neighbours, by taking
that which did not belong to him, or by any act
calculated to displease the village chiefs or offend
the Great Spirit. His chief ambition was to support
his family with a sufficiency of food and skins by
his own unaided exertions, and to share their happiness
around his cheerful fire at night. The white
man had not yet taught them that blankets and
clothes were necessary to their comfort, or that
guns could be used in the killing of game.</p>

<p>The life of the Chippewa hunter peacefully glided
away.</p>

<p>One evening during the winter season, it chanced
that he remained out later than usual, and his wife
sat lonely in the lodge, and began to be agitated
with fears lest some accident had befallen him.
Darkness had already fallen. She listened attentively
to hear the sound of coming footsteps; but
nothing could be heard but the wind mournfully
whistling around the sides of the lodge. Time
passed away while she remained in this state of
suspense, every moment augmenting her fears and
adding to her disappointment.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard the sound of approaching
footsteps upon the frozen surface of the snow. Not
doubting that it was her husband, she quickly unfastened
the loop which held, by an inner fastening,
the skin door of the lodge, and throwing it open
she saw two strange women standing before it.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Courtesy left the hunter&rsquo;s wife no time for deliberation.
She invited the strangers to enter and warm
themselves, thinking, from the distance to the
nearest neighbours, they must have walked a considerable
way. When they were entered she invited
them to remain. They seemed to be total
strangers to that part of the country, and the more
closely she observed them the more curious the hunter&rsquo;s
wife became respecting her guests.</p>

<p>No efforts could induce them to come near the
fire. They took their seats in a remote part of the
lodge, and drew their garments about them in such
a manner as to almost completely hide their faces.
They seemed shy and reserved, and when a glimpse
could be had of their faces they appeared pale, even
of a deathly hue. Their eyes were bright but
sunken: their cheek-bones were prominent, and
their persons slender and emaciated.</p>

<p>Seeing that her guests avoided conversation as
well as observation, the woman forbore to question
them, and sat in silence until her husband entered.
He had been led further than usual in the pursuit
of game, but had returned with the carcass of a
large and fat deer. The moment he entered the
lodge, the mysterious women exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold! what a fine and fat animal!&rdquo; and they
immediately ran and pulled off pieces of the whitest
fat, which they ate with avidity.</p>

<p>Such conduct appeared very strange to the hunter,
but supposing the strangers had been a long time
without food, he made no remark; and his wife,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
taking example from her husband, likewise restrained
herself.</p>

<p>On the following evening the same scene was
repeated. The hunter brought home the best portions
of the game he had killed, and while he was
laying it down before his wife, according to custom,
the two strange women came quickly up, tore off
large pieces of fat, and ate them with greediness.
Such behaviour might well have aroused the hunter&rsquo;s
displeasure; but the deference due to strange guests
induced him to pass it over in silence.</p>

<p>Observing the parts to which the strangers were
most partial, the hunter resolved the next day to
anticipate their wants by cutting off and tying up a
portion of the fat for each. This he did: and having
placed the two portions of fat upon the top of his
burden, as soon as he entered the lodge he gave to
each stranger the part that was hers. Still the
guests appeared to be dissatisfied, and took more
from the carcass lying before the wife.</p>

<p>Except for this remarkable behaviour, the conduct
of the guests was unexceptionable, although marked
by some peculiarities. They were quiet, modest,
and discreet. They maintained a cautious silence
during the day, neither uttering a word nor moving
from the lodge. At night they would get up, and,
taking those implements which were then used in
breaking and preparing wood, repair to the forest.
Here they would busy themselves in seeking dry
branches and pieces of trees blown down by the
wind. When a sufficient quantity had been gathered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to last until the succeeding night they carried it
home upon their shoulders. Then carefully putting
everything in its place within the lodge, they resumed
their seats and their studied silence. They
were always careful to return from their labours
before the dawn of day, and were never known to
stay out beyond that hour. In this manner they
repaid, in some measure, the kindness of the hunter,
and relieved his wife from one of her most laborious
duties.</p>

<p>Thus nearly the whole year passed away, every
day leading to some new development of character
which served to endear the parties to each other.
The visitors began to assume a more hale and
healthy aspect; their faces daily lost something
of that deathly hue which had at first marked them,
and they visibly improved in strength, and threw
off some of that cold reserve and forbidding austerity
which had kept the hunter so long in ignorance of
their true character.</p>

<p>One evening the hunter returned very late after
having spent the day in toilsome exertion, and having
laid the produce of his hunt at his wife&rsquo;s feet,
the silent women seized it and began to tear off the
fat in such an unceremonious manner that the wife
could no longer control her feelings of disgust, and
said to herself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is really too bad. How can I bear it any
longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not, however, put her thought into words,
but an immediate change was observed in the two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
visitors. They became unusually reserved, and
showed evident signs of being uneasy in their situation.
The good hunter immediately perceived this
change, and, fearful that they had taken offence, as
soon as they had retired demanded of his wife
whether any harsh expression had escaped her lips
during the day. She replied that she had uttered
nothing to give the least offence. The hunter tried
to compose himself to sleep, but he felt restive and
uneasy, for he could hear the sighs and lamentations
of the two strangers. Every moment added to his
conviction that his guests had taken some deep
offence; and, as he could not banish this idea from
his mind, he arose, and, going to the strangers, thus
addressed them&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, ye women, what is it that causes you
pain of mind, and makes you utter these unceasing
sighs? Has my wife given you any cause of offence
during the day while I was absent in the chase?
My fears persuade me that, in some unguarded
moment, she has forgotten what is due to the rights
of hospitality, and used expressions ill-befitting the
mysterious character you sustain. Tell me, ye
strangers from a strange country, ye women who
appear not to be of this world, what it is that causes
you pain of mind, and makes you utter these unceasing
sighs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They replied that no unkind expression had ever
been used towards them during their residence in
the lodge, that they had received all the affectionate
attention they could reasonably expect.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is not for ourselves,&rdquo; they continued, &ldquo;it is
not for ourselves that we weep. We are weeping
for the fate of mankind; we are weeping for the
fate of mortals whom Death awaits at every stage of
their existence. Proud mortals, whom disease
attacks in youth and in age. Vain men, whom
hunger pinches, cold benumbs, and poverty emaciates.
Weak beings, who are born in tears, who
are nurtured in tears, and whose whole course is
marked upon the thirsty sands of life in a broad line
of tears. It is for these we weep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have spoken truly, brother; we are not of
this world. We are spirits from the land of the
dead, sent upon the earth to try the sincerity
of the living. It is not for the dead but for the
living that we mourn. It was by no means necessary
that your wife should express her thoughts
to us. We knew them as soon as they were formed.
We saw that for once displeasure had arisen in her
heart. It is enough. Our mission is ended. We
came but to try you, and we knew before we came
that you were a kind husband, an affectionate father,
and a good friend. Still, you have the weaknesses
of a mortal, and your wife is wanting in our eyes;
but it is not alone for you we weep, it is for the fate
of mankind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Often, very often, has the widower exclaimed,
&lsquo;O Death, how cruel, how relentless thou art to take
away my beloved friend in the spring of her youth,
in the pride of her strength, and in the bloom of her
beauty! If thou wilt permit her once more to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
return to my abode, my gratitude shall never cease;
I will raise up my voice continually to thank the
Master of Life for so excellent a boon. I will devote
my time to study how I can best promote her happiness
while she is permitted to remain; and our
lives shall roll away like a pleasant stream through
a flowing valley!&rsquo; Thus also has the father prayed
for his son, the mother for her daughter, the wife
for her husband, the sister for her brother, the lover
for his mistress, the friend for his bosom companion,
until the sounds of mourning and the cries of the
living have pierced the very recesses of the dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit has at length consented to make
a trial of the sincerity of these prayers by sending
us upon the earth. He has done this to see how we
should be received,&mdash;coming as strangers, no one
knowing from where. Three moons were allotted to
us to make the trial, and if, during that time, no
impatience had been evinced, no angry passions
excited at the place where we took up our abode,
all those in the land of spirits, whom their relatives
had desired to return, would have been restored.
More than two moons have already passed, and as
soon as the leaves began to bud our mission would
have been successfully terminated. It is now too
late. Our trial is finished, and we are called to the
pleasant fields whence we came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother, it is proper that one man should die to
make room for another. Otherwise, the world would
be filled to overflowing. It is just that the goods
gathered by one should be left to be divided among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
others; for in the land of spirits there is no want,
there is neither sorrow nor hunger, pain nor death.
Pleasant fields, filled with game spread before the
eye, with birds of beautiful form. Every stream has
good fish in it, and every hill is crowned with groves
of fruit-trees, sweet and pleasant to the taste. It is
not here, brother, but there that men begin truly to
live. It is not for those who rejoice in those pleasant
groves but for you that are left behind that we weep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother, take our thanks for your hospitable
treatment. Regret not our departure. Fear not
evil. Thy luck shall still be good in the chase, and
there shall ever be a bright sky over thy lodge.
Mourn not for us, for no corn will spring up from
tears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spirits ceased, but the hunter had no power
over his voice to reply. As they had proceeded in
their address he saw a light gradually beaming from
their faces, and a blue vapour filled the lodge with
an unnatural light. As soon as they ceased, darkness
gradually closed around. The hunter listened,
but the sobs of the spirits had ceased. He heard
the door of his tent open and shut, but he never
saw more of his mysterious visitors.</p>

<p>The success promised him was his. He became a
celebrated hunter, and never wanted for anything
necessary to his ease. He became the father of
many boys, all of whom grew up to manhood, and
health, peace, and long life were the rewards of his
hospitality.</p>

<h2>MANABOZHO AND HIS TOE.</h2>


<p>Manabozho was so powerful that he began to think
there was nothing he could not do. Very wonderful
were many of his feats, and he grew more conceited
day by day. Now it chanced that one day he was
walking about amusing himself by exercising his
extraordinary powers, and at length he came to an
encampment where one of the first things he noticed
was a child lying in the sunshine, curled up with its
toe in its mouth.</p>

<p>Manabozho looked at the child for some time, and
wondered at its extraordinary posture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never seen a child before lie like that,&rdquo;
said he to himself, &ldquo;but I could lie like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he put himself down beside the child,
and, taking his right foot in his hand, drew it towards
his mouth. When he had brought it as near as he
could it was yet a considerable distance away from
his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try the left foot,&rdquo; said Manabozho. He
did so and found that he was no better off, neither
of his feet could he get to his mouth. He curled
and twisted, and bent his large limbs, and gnashed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
his teeth in rage to find that he could not get his toe
to his mouth. All, however, was vain.</p>

<p>At length he rose, worn out with his exertions and
passion, and walked slowly away in a very ill
humour, which was not lessened by the sound of
the child&rsquo;s laughter, for Manabozho&rsquo;s efforts had
awakened it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ah!&rdquo; said Manabozho, &ldquo;shall I be mocked
by a child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not, however, revenge himself on his
victor, but on his way homeward, meeting a boy
who did not treat him with proper respect, he
transformed him into a cedar-tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said Manabozho, &ldquo;I can do something.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE GIRL WHO BECAME A BIRD.</h2>


<p>The father of Ran-che-wai-me, the flying pigeon of
the Wisconsin, would not hear of her wedding Wai-o-naisa,
the young chief who had long sought her in
marriage. The maiden, however, true to her plighted
faith, still continued to meet him every evening upon
one of the tufted islets which stud the river in great
profusion. Nightly, through the long months of
summer, did the lovers keep their tryst, parting only
after each meeting more and more endeared to each
other.</p>

<p>At length Wai-o-naisa was ordered off upon a
secret expedition against the Sioux, and so sudden
was his departure that he had no opportunity of
bidding farewell to his betrothed. The band of
warriors to which he was attached was a long while
absent, and one day there came the news that Wai-o-naisa
had fallen in a fight with the Menomones.</p>

<p>Ran-che-wai-me was inconsolable, but she dared
not show her grief before her parents, and the only
relief she could find from her sorrow was to swim
over by starlight to the island where she had been
accustomed to meet her lover, and there, calling upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
his name, bewail the loss of him who was dearer to
her than all else.</p>

<p>One night, while she was engaged in this lamentation,
the sound of her voice attracted some of her
father&rsquo;s people to the spot. Startled by their appearance
the girl tried to climb a tree, in order to hide
herself in its branches, but her frame was bowed
with sorrow and her weak limbs refused to aid her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wai-o-naisa!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Wai-o-naisa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At each repetition of his name her voice became
shriller, while, as she endeavoured to screen herself
in the underwood, a soft plumage began to cover her
delicate limbs, which were wounded by the briers.
She tossed her arms to the sky in her distress and
they became clothed with feathers. At length,
when her pursuers were close upon her, a bird arose
from the bush they had surrounded, and flitting
from tree to tree, it fled before them, ever crying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wai-o-naisa! Wai-o-naisa!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE UNDYING HEAD.</h2>


<p>In a remote part of the north lived a man and his
only sister who had never seen human being.
Seldom, if ever, had the man any cause to go from
home, for if he wanted food he had only to go a
little distance from the lodge, and there place his
arrows with their barbs in the ground. He would
then return to the lodge and tell his sister where the
arrows had been placed, when she would go in search
of them, and never fail to find each struck through
the heart of a deer. These she dragged to the lodge
and dressed for food. Thus she lived until she
attained womanhood. One day her brother, who
was named Iamo, said to her&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sister, the time is near when you will be ill.
Listen to my advice, for if you do not it will probably
be the cause of my death. Take the implements
with which we kindle our fires, go some distance
from our lodge and build a separate fire. When you
are in want of food I will tell you where to find it.
You must cook for yourself and I for myself. When
you are ill do not attempt to come near the lodge
or bring to it any of the utensils you use. Be sure
to always have fastened to your belt whatever you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
will need in your sickness, for you do not know
when the time of your indisposition will come. As
for myself, I must do the best I can.&rdquo; His sister
promised to obey him in all he said.</p>

<p>Shortly after her brother had cause to go from
home. His sister was alone in the lodge combing
her hair, and she had just untied and laid aside the
belt to which the implements were fastened when
suddenly she felt unwell. She ran out of the lodge,
but in her haste forgot the belt. Afraid to return
she stood some time thinking, and finally she
determined to return to the lodge and get it, for she
said to herself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother is not at home, and I will stay but a
moment to catch hold of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went back, and, running in, suddenly seized
the belt, and was coming out, when her brother met
her. He knew what had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to take care?
Now you have killed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His sister would have gone away, but he spoke to
her again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you do now? What I feared has
happened. Go in, and stay where you have always
lived. You have killed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then laid aside his hunting dress and accoutrements,
and soon after both his feet began to inflame
and turn black, so that he could not move. He
directed his sister where to place his arrows, so that
she might always have food. The inflammation continued
to increase, and had now reached his first rib.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my end is near. You must do
as I tell you. You see my medicine-sack and my
war-club tied to it. It contains all my medicines,
my war-plumes, and my paints of all colours. As
soon as the inflammation reaches my chest, you will
take my war-club, and with the sharp point of it cut
off my head. When it is free from my body, take it,
place its neck in the sack, which you must open at
one end. Then hang it up in its former place. Do
not forget my bow and arrows. One of the last you
will take to procure food. Tie the others to my
sack, and then hang it up so that I can look towards
the door. Now and then I will speak to you, but
not often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His sister again promised to obey.</p>

<p>In a little time his chest became affected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;take the club and strike off my
head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His sister was afraid, but he told her to muster up
courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike,&rdquo; said he, with a smile upon his face.</p>

<p>Calling up all her courage, his sister struck and
cut off the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the head, &ldquo;place me where I told
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fearful, she obeyed it in all its commands.</p>

<p>Retaining its animation, it looked round the lodge
as usual, and it would command its sister to go to
such places where it thought she could best procure
the flesh of the different animals she needed. One
day the head said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
&ldquo;The time is not distant when I shall be freed
from this situation, but I shall have to undergo many
sore evils. So the Superior Manito decrees, and I
must bear all patiently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a certain part of the country was a village
inhabited by a numerous and warlike band of Indians.
In this village was a family of ten young men,
brothers. In the spring of the year the youngest of
these blackened his face and fasted. His dreams
were propitious, and having ended his fast, he sent
secretly for his brothers at night, so that the people
in the village should not be aware of their meeting.
He told them how favourable his dreams had been,
and that he had called them together to ask them if
they would accompany him in a war excursion.
They all answered they would. The third son, noted
for his oddities, swinging his war-club when his
brother had ceased speaking, jumped up: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I will go, and this will be the way I will
treat those we go to fight with.&rdquo; With those words
he struck the post in the centre of the lodge, and gave
a yell. The other brothers spoke to him, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gently, gently, Mudjikewis, when you are in
other people&rsquo;s lodges.&rdquo; So he sat down. Then, in
turn, they took the drum, sang their songs, and closed
the meeting with a feast. The youngest told them
not to whisper their intention to their wives, but to
prepare secretly for their journey. They all promised
obedience, and Mudjikewis was the first to do so.</p>

<p>The time for departure drew near. The youngest
gave the word for them to assemble on a certain night,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
when they would commence their journey. Mudjikewis
was loud in his demands for his moccasins, and
his wife several times demanded the reason of his
impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you have a good pair on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, quick,&rdquo; replied Mudjikewis; &ldquo;since you
must know, we are going on a war excursion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus he revealed the secret.</p>

<p>That night they met and started. The snow was
on the ground, and they travelled all night lest
others should follow them. When it was daylight,
the leader took snow, made a ball of it, and tossing
it up in the air, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in this way I saw snow fall in my dream,
so that we could not be tracked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately snow began to fall in large flakes, so
that the leader commanded the brothers to keep
close together for fear of losing one another. Close
as they walked together it was with difficulty they
could see one another. The snow continued falling
all that day and the next night, so that it was
impossible for any one to follow their track.</p>

<p>They walked for several days, and Mudjikewis
was always in the rear. One day, running suddenly
forward, he gave the Saw-saw-quan (war-cry), and
struck a tree with his war-club, breaking the tree in
pieces as if it had been struck by lightning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is the way I will serve
those we are going to fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The leader answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slowly, slowly, Mudjikewis. The one I lead
you to is not to be thought of so lightly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Again Mudjikewis fell back and thought to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, what! Who can this be he is leading
us to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt fearful, and was silent. Day after day
they travelled on till they came to an extensive
plain, on the borders of which human bones were
bleaching in the sun. The leader said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are the bones of those who have gone
before us. None has ever yet returned to tell the
sad tale of their fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Mudjikewis became restless, and, running
forward, gave the accustomed yell. Advancing to a
large rock which stood above the ground he struck
it, and it fell to pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, brothers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thus will I treat those
we are going to fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; said the leader. &ldquo;He to whom I
am leading you is not to be compared to that rock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mudjikewis fell back quite thoughtful, saying to
himself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who this can be that he is going to
attack;&rdquo; and he was afraid.</p>

<p>They continued to see the remains of former
warriors who had been to the place to which they
were now going, and had retreated thus far back
again. At last they came to a piece of rising ground,
from which they plainly saw on a distant mountain
an enormous bear. The distance between them was
very great, but the size of the animal caused it to be
seen very clearly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the leader; &ldquo;it is to him I am
leading you. Here our troubles will only commence,
for he is a mishemokwa&rdquo; (a she-bear, or a male-bear
as ferocious as a she-bear) &ldquo;and a manito. It is
he who has what we prize so dearly, to obtain which
the warriors whose bones we saw sacrificed their
lives. You must not be fearful. Be manly; we
shall find him asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The warriors advanced boldly till they came near
to the bear, when they stopped to look at it more
closely. It was asleep, and there was a belt around
its neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the leader, touching the belt, &ldquo;is
what we must get. It contains what we want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eldest brother then tried to slip the belt over
the bear&rsquo;s head, the animal appearing to be fast
asleep, and not at all disturbed by his efforts. He
could not, however, remove the belt, nor was any of
the brothers more successful till the one next to the
youngest tried in his turn. He slipped the belt
nearly over the beast&rsquo;s head, but could not get it
quite off. Then the youngest laid his hands on
it, and with a pull succeeded. Placing the belt on
the eldest brother&rsquo;s back, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we must run,&rdquo; and they started off at their
best pace. When one became tired with the weight
of the belt another carried it. Thus they ran till
they had passed the bones of all the warriors, and
when they were some distance beyond, looking back,
they saw the monster slowly rising. For some time
it stood still, not missing the belt. Then they heard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
a tremendous howl, like distant thunder, slowly
filling the sky. At last they heard the bear cry&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can it be that has dared to steal my belt?
Earth is not so large but I can find them,&rdquo; and it
descended the hill in pursuit. With every jump of
the bear the earth shook as if it were convulsed.
Very soon it approached the party. They, however,
kept the belt, exchanging it from one to another,
and encouraging each other. The bear, however,
gained on them fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; said the leader, &ldquo;have none of you,
when fasting, ever dreamed of some friendly spirit
who would aid you as a guardian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dead silence followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;once when I was fasting
I dreamed of being in danger of instant death,
when I saw a small lodge, with smoke curling up
from its top. An old man lived in it, and I dreamed
that he helped me, and may my dream be verified
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having said this, he ran forward and gave a yell
and howl. They came upon a piece of rising
ground, and, behold! a lodge with smoke curling
from its top appeared before them. This gave them
all new strength, and they ran forward and entered
the lodge. In it they found an old man, to whom
the leader said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nemesho (my grandfather), help us. We ask
your protection, for the great bear would kill us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down and eat, my grandchildren,&rdquo; said the
old man. &ldquo;Who is a great manito? There is none
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
but me; but let me look;&rdquo; and he opened the door
of the lodge, and saw at a little distance the enraged
bear coming on with slow but great leaps. The old
man closed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;he is indeed a great manito.
My grandchildren, you will be the cause of my losing
my life. You asked my protection, and I granted
it; so now, come what may, I will protect you.
When the bear arrives at the door you must run
out at the other end of the lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting his hand to the side of the lodge where he
sat, he took down a bag, and, opening it, took out of
it two small black dogs, which he placed before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are the ones I use when I fight,&rdquo; said he,
and he commenced patting with both hands the sides
of one of the dogs, which at once commenced to
swell out until it filled the lodge, and it had great
strong teeth. When the dog had attained its full
size it growled, and, springing out at the door, met
the bear, which, in another leap, would have reached
the lodge. A terrible combat ensued. The sky rang
with the howls of the monsters. In a little while the
second dog took the field. At the commencement
of the battle the brothers, acting on the advice of
the old man, escaped through the opposite side of
the lodge. They had not proceeded far in their
flight before they heard the death-cry of one of the
dogs, and soon after that of the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the leader, &ldquo;the old man will soon
share their fate, so run, run! the bear will soon be
after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
The brothers started with fresh vigour, for the old
man had refreshed them with food; but the bear
very soon came in sight again, and was evidently
fast gaining upon them. Again the leader asked
the warriors if they knew of any way in which to
save themselves. All were silent. Running forward
with a yell and a howl, the leader said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamed once that, being in great trouble, an
old man, who was a manito, helped me. We shall
soon see his lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking courage, the brothers still went on, and,
after going a short distance, they saw a lodge.
Entering it, they found an old man, whose protection
they claimed, saying that a manito was pursuing
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat,&rdquo; said the old man, putting meat before
them. &ldquo;Who is a manito? There is no manito
but me. There is none whom I fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he felt the earth tremble as the bear approached,
and, opening the door of the lodge, he
saw it coming. The old man shut the door slowly,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my grandchildren, you have brought trouble
upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking his medicine sack, he took out some small
war-clubs of black stone, and told the young men
to run through the other side of the lodge. As he
handled the clubs they became an enormous size,
and the old man stepped out as the bear reached
the door. He struck the beast with one of his clubs,
which broke in pieces, and the bear stumbled. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
old man struck it again with the other club, and
that also broke, but the bear fell insensible. Each
blow the old man struck sounded like a clap of
thunder, and the howls of the bear ran along the
skies.</p>

<p>The brothers had gone some distance before they
looked back. They then saw that the bear was
recovering from the blows. First it moved its paws,
and then they saw it rise to its feet. The old man
shared the fate of the first, for the warriors heard
his cries as he was torn in pieces. Again the monster
was in pursuit, and fast overtaking them. Not yet
discouraged, the young men kept on their way, but
the bear was so close to them that the leader once
more applied to his brothers, but they could do
nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my dreams will soon be exhausted.
After this I have but one more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He advanced, invoking his guardian spirit to aid
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I dreamed that, being sorely
pressed, I came to a large lake, on the shore of
which was a canoe, partly out of water, and having
ten paddles all in readiness. Do not fear,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;we shall soon get to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It happened as he had said. Coming to the lake,
the warriors found the canoe with the ten paddles,
and immediately took their places in it. Putting
off, they paddled to the centre of the lake, when
they saw the bear on the shore. Lifting itself on
its hind-legs, it looked all around. Then it waded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
into the water until, losing its footing, it turned
back, and commenced making the circuit of the lake.
Meanwhile the warriors remained stationary in the
centre watching the animal&rsquo;s movements. It travelled
round till it came to the place whence it started.
Then it commenced drinking up the water, and the
young men saw a strong current fast setting in
towards the bear&rsquo;s mouth. The leader encouraged
them to paddle hard for the opposite shore. This
they had nearly reached, when the current became
too strong for them, and they were drawn back by it,
and the stream carried them onwards to the bear.</p>

<p>Then the leader again spoke, telling his comrades
to meet their fate bravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now is the time, Mudjikewis,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
show your prowess. Take courage, and sit in the
bow of the canoe, and, when it approaches the bear&rsquo;s
mouth, try what effect your club will have on the
beast&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mudjikewis obeyed, and, taking his place, stood
ready to give the blow, while the leader, who
steered, directed the canoe to the open mouth of the
monster.</p>

<p>Rapidly advancing, the canoe was just about to
enter the bear&rsquo;s mouth, when Mudjikewis struck the
beast a tremendous blow on the head, and gave the
saw-saw-quan. The bear&rsquo;s limbs doubled under it,
and it fell stunned by the blow, but before Mudjikewis
could strike again the monster sent from its
mouth all the water it had swallowed with such
force that the canoe was immediately carried by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
stream to the other side of the lake. Leaving the
canoe, the brothers fled, and on they went till they
were completely exhausted. Again they felt the
earth shake, and, looking back, saw the monster
hard after them. The young men&rsquo;s spirits drooped,
and they felt faint-hearted. With words and actions
the leader exerted himself to cheer them, and once
more he asked them if they could do nothing, or
think of nothing, that might save them. All were
silent as before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is the last time I can
apply to my guardian spirit. If we do not now
succeed, our fate is decided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran forward, invoking his spirit with great
earnestness, and gave the yell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall soon arrive,&rdquo; said he to his brothers,
&ldquo;at the place where my last guardian spirit dwells.
In him I place great confidence. Do not be afraid,
or your limbs will be fear-bound. We shall soon
reach his lodge. Run, run!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What had in the meantime passed in the lodge of
Iamo? He had remained in the same condition, his
head in the sack, directing his sister where to place the
arrows to procure food, and speaking at long intervals.</p>

<p>One day the girl saw the eyes of the head brighten
as if with pleasure. At last it spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O sister!&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;in what a pitiful situation
you have been the cause of placing me! Soon,
very soon, a band of young men will arrive and
apply to me for aid; but alas! how can I give
what I would with so much pleasure have afforded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
them? Nevertheless, take two arrows, and place
them where you have been in the habit of placing
the others, and have meat cooked and prepared
before they arrive. When you hear them coming,
and calling on my name, go out and say, &lsquo;Alas! it
is long ago since an accident befell him. I was the
cause of it.&rsquo; If they still come near, ask them in,
and set meat before them. Follow my directions
strictly. A bear will come. Go out and meet him,
taking my medicine sack, bow and arrows, and my
head. You must then untie the sack, and spread
out before you my paints of all colours, my war
eagle-feathers, my tufts of dried hair, and whatsoever
else the sack contains. As the bear approaches
take these articles, one by one, and say to him,
&lsquo;This is my dead brother&rsquo;s paint,&rsquo; and so on with all
the articles, throwing each of them as far from you
as you can. The virtue contained in the things will
cause him to totter. Then, to complete his destruction,
you must take my head and cast it as far off
as you can, crying aloud, &lsquo;See, this is my dead
brother&rsquo;s head!&rsquo; He will then fall senseless. While
this is taking place the young men will have eaten,
and you must call them to your aid. You will, with
their assistance, cut the carcass of the bear into
pieces&mdash;into small pieces&mdash;and scatter them to the
winds, for unless you do this he will again come to
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sister promised that all should be done as he
commanded, and she had only time to prepare the
meal when the voice of the leader of the band of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
warriors was heard calling on Iamo for aid. The
girl went out and did as she had been directed.
She invited the brothers in and placed meat before
them, and while they were eating the bear was heard
approaching. Untying the medicine sack and taking
the head the girl made all ready for its approach.
When it came up she did as her brother directed,
and before she had cast down all the paints the bear
began to totter, but, still advancing, came close to
her. Then she took the head and cast it from her
as far as she could, and as it rolled upon the ground
the bear, tottering, fell with a tremendous noise.
The girl cried for help, and the young men rushed
out.</p>

<p>Mudjikewis, stepping up, gave a yell, and struck
the bear a blow on the head. This he repeated till
he had dashed out its brains. Then the others, as
quickly as possible, cut the monster up into very
small pieces and scattered them in all directions.
As they were engaged in this they were surprised to
find that wherever the flesh was thrown small black
bears appeared, such as are seen at the present day,
which, starting up, ran away. Thus from this monster
the present race of bears derives its origin.</p>

<p>Having overcome their pursuer the brothers returned
to the lodge, and the girl gathered together
the articles she had used, and placed the head in the
sack again. The head remained silent, probably
from its being fatigued with its exertion in overcoming
the bear.</p>

<p>Having spent so much time, and having traversed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
so vast a country in their flight, the young men
gave up the idea of ever returning to their own
country, and game being plentiful about the lodge,
they determined to remain where they were. One
day they moved off some distance from the lodge for
the purpose of hunting, and left the belt with the
girl. They were very successful, and amused themselves
with talking and jesting. One of them
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have all this sport to ourselves. Let us go
and ask our sister if she will not let us bring the
head to this place, for it is still alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they went and asked for the head. The girl
told them to take it, and they carried it to their
hunting-grounds and tried to amuse it, but only at
times did they see its eyes beam with pleasure. One
day, while they were busy in their encampment, they
were unexpectedly attacked by unknown enemies.
The fight was long and fierce. Many of the foes
were slain, but there were thirty of them to each
warrior. The young men fought desperately till
they were all killed, and then the attacking party
retreated to a high place to muster their men and
count the missing and the slain. One of the men
had strayed away, and happened to come to where
the head was hung up. Seeing that it was alive
he eyed it for some time with fear and surprise.
Then he took it down, and having opened the sack
he was much pleased to see the beautiful feathers,
one of which he placed on his head.</p>

<p>It waved gracefully over him as he walked to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
companions&rsquo; camp, and when he came there he threw
down the head and sack and told his friends how he
had found them, and how the sack was full of paints
and feathers. The men all took the head and made
sport of it. Many of the young men took the paint
and painted themselves with it; and one of the
band, taking the head by the hair, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, you ugly thing, and see your paints on
the faces of warriors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The feathers were so beautiful that many of the
young men placed them on their heads, and they
again subjected the head to all kinds of indignity.
They were, however, soon punished for their insulting
conduct, for all who had worn the feathers
became sick and died. Then the chief commanded
the men to throw all the paints and feathers away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for the head,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will keep that
and take it home with us; we will there see what we
can do with it. We will try to make it shut its eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile for several days the sister had been
waiting for the brothers to bring back the head; till
at last, getting impatient, she went in search of
them. She found them lying within short distances
of one another, dead, and covered with wounds.
Other bodies lay scattered around. She searched
for the head and sack, but they were nowhere to be
found, so she raised her voice and wept, and blackened
her face. Then she walked in different directions
till she came to the place whence the head had been
taken, and there she found the bow and arrows, which
had been left behind. She searched further, hoping
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
to find her brother&rsquo;s head, and, when she came to a
piece of rising ground she found some of his paints
and feathers. These she carefully put by, hanging
them to the branch of a tree.</p>

<p>At dusk she came to the first lodge of a large village.
Here she used a charm employed by Indians when
they wish to meet with a kind reception, and on
applying to the old man and the woman who
occupied the lodge she was made welcome by them.
She told them her errand, and the old man, promising
to help her, told her that the head was hung up
before the council fire, and that the chiefs and young
men of the village kept watch over it continually.
The girl said she only desired to see the head, and
would be satisfied if she could only get to the door
of the lodge in which it was hung, for she knew she
could not take it by force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I will take
you there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they went and took their seats in the lodge near to
the door. The council lodge was filled with warriors
amusing themselves with games, and constantly keeping
up the fire to smoke the head to dry it. As the
girl entered the lodge the men saw the features of the
head move, and, not knowing what to make of it,
one spoke and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! it is beginning to feel the effects of the
smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sister looked up from the seat by the door;
her eyes met those of her brother, and tears began
to roll down the cheeks of the head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the chief, &ldquo;I thought we would make
you do something at last. Look! look at it shedding
tears,&rdquo; said he to those around him, and they
all laughed and made jokes upon it. The chief,
looking around, observed the strange girl, and after
some time said to the old man who brought her in&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who have you got there? I have never seen
that woman before in our village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;you have seen her.
She is a relation of mine, and seldom goes out. She
stays in my lodge, and she asked me to bring her here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the centre of the lodge sat one of those young
men who are always forward, and fond of boasting
and displaying themselves before others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have seen her often, and it is
to his lodge I go almost every night to court her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the others laughed and continued their games.
The young man did not know he was telling a lie to
the girl&rsquo;s advantage, who by means of it escaped.</p>

<p>She returned to the old man&rsquo;s lodge, and immediately
set out for her own country. Coming to the
spot where the bodies of her adopted brothers lay,
she placed them together with their feet towards the
east. Then taking an axe she had she cast it up
into the air, crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brothers, get up from under it or it will fall on
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This she repeated three times, and the third time
all the brothers rose and stood on their feet. Mudjikewis
commenced rubbing his eyes and stretching
himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have overslept myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said one of the others. &ldquo;Do you
not know we were all killed, and that it is our sister
who has brought us to life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brothers then took the bodies of their enemies
and burned them. Soon after the girl went to a far
country, they knew not where, to procure wives for
them, and she returned with the women, whom she
gave to the young men, beginning with the eldest.
Mudjikewis stepped to and fro, uneasy lest he should
not get the one he liked, but he was not disappointed,
for she fell to his lot; and the two were well matched,
for she was a female magician.</p>

<p>The young men and their wives all moved into a
very large lodge, and their sister told them that one
of the women must go in turns every night to try
and recover the head of her brother, untying the
knots by which it was hung up in the council lodge.
The women all said they would go with pleasure.
The eldest made the first attempt. With a rushing
noise she disappeared through the air.</p>

<p>Towards daylight she returned. She had failed,
having only succeeded in untying one of the knots.
All the women save the youngest went in turn, and
each one succeeded in untying only one knot each
time. At length the youngest went. As soon as
she arrived at the lodge she went to work. The
smoke from the fire in the lodge had not ascended
for ten nights. It now filled the place and drove all
the men out. The girl was alone, and she carried off
the head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
The brothers and Iamo&rsquo;s sister heard the young
woman coming high through the air, and they heard
her say&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prepare the body of our brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as they heard that they went to where
Iamo&rsquo;s body lay, and, having got it ready, as soon as
the young woman arrived with the head they placed
it to the body, and Iamo was restored in all his
former manliness and beauty. All rejoiced in the
happy termination of their troubles, and when they
had spent some time joyfully together, Iamo said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I will divide the treasure,&rdquo; and taking the
bear&rsquo;s belt he commenced dividing what it contained
amongst the brothers, beginning with the eldest.
The youngest brother, however, got the most splendid
part of the spoil, for the bottom of the belt held
what was richest and rarest.</p>

<p>Then Iamo told them that, since they had all died
and been restored to life again, they were no longer
mortals but spirits, and he assigned to each of them
a station in the invisible world. Only Mudjikewis&rsquo;
place was, however, named. He was to direct the
west wind. The brothers were commanded, as they
had it in their power, to do good to the inhabitants
of the earth, and to give all things with a liberal
hand.</p>

<p>The spirits then, amid songs and shouts, took their
flight to their respective places, while Iamo and his
sister, Iamoqua, descended into the depths below.</p>

<h2>THE OLD CHIPPEWAY.</h2>


<p>The old man Chippeway, the first of men, when he
first landed on the earth, near where the present
Dogribs have their hunting-grounds, found the
world a beautiful world, well stocked with food, and
abounding with pleasant things. He found no man,
woman, or child upon it; but in time, being lonely,
he created children, to whom he gave two kinds of
fruit, the black and the white, but he forbade them
to eat the black. Having given his commands for
the government and guidance of his family, he took
leave of them for a time, to go into a far country
where the sun dwelt, for the purpose of bringing it
to the earth.</p>

<p>After a very long journey, and a long absence,
he returned, bringing with him the sun, and he
was delighted to find that his children had remained
obedient, and had eaten only of the white
food.</p>

<p>Again he left them to go on another expedition.
The sun he had brought lighted up the earth for
only a short time, and in the land from which he
had brought it he had noticed another body, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
served as a lamp in the dark hours. He resolved
therefore to journey and bring back with him the
moon; so, bidding adieu to his children and his
dwelling, he set forth once more.</p>

<p>While he had been absent on his first expedition,
his children had eaten up all the white food, and
now, when he set out, he forgot to provide them
with a fresh supply. For a long time they resisted
the craving for food, but at last they could hold out
no longer, and satisfied their hunger with the black
fruit.</p>

<p>The old Chippeway soon returned, bringing with
him the moon. He soon discovered that his children
had transgressed his command, and had eaten the
food of disease and death. He told them what was
the consequence of their act&mdash;that in future the earth
would produce bad fruits, that sickness would come
amongst men, that pain would rack them, and their
lives be lives of fatigue and danger.</p>

<p>Having brought the sun and moon to the earth,
the old man Chippeway rested, and made no more
expeditions. He lived an immense number of years,
and saw all the troubles he declared would follow
the eating of the black food. At last he became
tired of life, and his sole desire was to be freed
from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said he, to one of his sons, &ldquo;to the river
of the Bear Lake, and fetch me a man of the little
wise people (the beavers). Let it be one with a
brown ring round the end of the tail, and a white spot
on the tip of the nose. Let him be just two seasons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
old upon the first day of the coming frog-moon, and
see that his teeth be sharp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man did as he was directed. He went to the
river of the Bear Lake, and brought a man of the
little wise people. He had a brown ring round the
end of his tail, and a white spot on the tip of his
nose. He was just two seasons old upon the first
day of the frog-moon, and his teeth were very sharp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the wise four-legged man,&rdquo; said the old
Chippeway, &ldquo;and pull from his jaws seven of his
teeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man did as he was directed, and brought the
teeth to the old man. Then he bade him call all
his people together, and when they were come the
old man thus addressed them&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am old, and am tired of life, and wish to sleep
the sleep of death. I will go hence. Take the seven
teeth of the wise little four-legged man and drive
them into my body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did so, and as the last tooth entered him the
old man died.</p>

<h2>MUKUMIK! MUKUMIK! MUKUMIK!</h2>


<p>Pauppukkeewis was a harum-scarum fellow who
played many queer tricks, but he took care, nevertheless,
to supply his family and children with food.
Sometimes, however, he was hard-pressed, and once
he and his whole family were on the point of starving.
Every resource seemed to have failed. The
snow was so deep, and the storm continued so long,
that he could not even find a partridge or a hare,
and his usual supply of fish had failed him. His
lodge stood in some woods not far away from the
shores of the Gitchiguma, or great water, where the
autumnal storms had piled up the ice into high pinnacles,
resembling castles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said he to his family one morning,
&ldquo;to these castles, and solicit the pity of the spirits
who inhabit them, for I know that they are the
residence of some of the spirits of Rabiboonoka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did so, and his petition was not disregarded.
The spirits told him to fill his mushkemoots or sacks
with the ice and snow, and pass on towards his lodge,
without looking back, until he came to a certain
hill. He was then to drop his sacks, and leave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
them till morning, when he would find them full
of fish.</p>

<p>The spirits cautioned him that he must by no
means look back, although he should hear a great
many voices crying out to him abusing him; for they
told him such voices would be in reality only the
wind playing through the branches of the trees.</p>

<p>Pauppukkeewis faithfully obeyed the directions
given him, although he found it difficult to avoid
looking round to see who was calling to him. When
he visited the sacks in the morning, he found them
filled with fish.</p>

<p>It happened that Manabozho visited him on the
morning when he brought the fish home, and the
visitor was invited to partake of the feast. While
they were eating, Manabozho could not help asking
where such an abundance of food had been procured
at a time when most were in a state of starvation.</p>

<p>Pauppukkeewis frankly told him the secret, and
and what precautions to take to ensure success.
Manabozho determined to profit by the information,
and, as soon as he could, set out to visit the icy
castles. All things happened as Pauppukkeewis had
told him. The spirits appeared to be kind, and told
Manabozho to fill and carry. He accordingly filled
his sacks with ice and snow, and then walked off
quickly to the hill where he was to leave them. As
he went, however, he heard voices calling out behind
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thief! thief! He has stolen fish from Rabiboonoka,&rdquo;
cried one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mukumik! Mukumik! take it away, take it
away,&rdquo; cried another.</p>

<p>Manabozho&rsquo;s ears were so assailed by all manner
of insulting cries, that at last he got angry, and,
quite forgetting the directions given him, he turned
his head to see who it was that was abusing him.
He saw no one, and proceeded on his way to the
hill, to which he was accompanied by his invisible
tormentors. He left his bags of ice and snow there,
to be changed into fish, and came back the next
morning. His disobedience had, however, dissolved
the charm, and he found his bags still full of rubbish.</p>

<p>In consequence of this he is condemned every
year, during the month of March, to run over the
hills, with Pauppukkeewis following him, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mukumik! Mukumik!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE SWING BY THE LAKE.</h2>


<p>There was an old hag of a woman who lived with
her daughter-in-law and her husband, with their son
and a little orphan boy. When her son-in-law came
home from hunting, it was his custom to bring his
wife the moose&rsquo;s lip, the kidney of the bear, or some
other choice bits of different animals. These the
girl would cook crisp, so that the sound of their
cracking could be heard when she ate them. This
kind attention of the hunter to his wife aroused the
envy of the old woman. She wished to have the
same luxuries, and, in order to obtain them, she at
last resolved to kill the young wife. One day she
asked her to leave her infant son to the care of the
orphan boy, and come out and swing with her. The
wife consented, and the mother-in-law took her to
the shore of a lake, where there was a high ridge of
rocks overhanging the water. Upon the top of
these rocks the old woman put up a swing, and,
having fastened a piece of leather round her body,
she commenced to swing herself, going over the
precipice each time. She continued this for a short
while, and then, stopping, told her daughter-in-law
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
to take her place. She did so, and, having tied the
leather round her, began to swing backwards and
forwards. When she was well going, sweeping at
each turn clear beyond the precipice, the old woman
slyly cut the cords, and let her drop into the lake.
She then put on some of the girl&rsquo;s clothing, entered
the lodge in the dusk of the evening, and went
about the work in which her daughter-in-law had
been usually occupied at such a time. She found
the child crying, and, since the mother was not there
to give it the breast, it cried on. Then the orphan
boy asked her where the mother was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is still swinging,&rdquo; replied the old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and look for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;you must not. What
would you go for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the evening, when the husband came in, he
gave the coveted morsels to what he supposed was
his wife. He missed the old woman, but asked
nothing about her. Meanwhile the woman ate the
morsels, and tried to quiet the child. The husband,
seeing that she kept her face away from him, was
astonished, and asked why the child cried so. His
pretended wife answered that she did not know.</p>

<p>In the meantime the orphan boy went to the
shores of the lake, where he found no one. Then
he suspected the old woman, and, having returned
to the lodge, told the hunter, while she was out
getting wood, all he had heard and seen. The man,
when he had heard the story, painted his face black,
and placed his spear upside down in the earth, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
requested the Great Spirit to send lightning, thunder,
and rain, in the hope that the body of his wife
might arise from the water. He then began to fast,
and told the boy to take the child and play upon
the lake shore.</p>

<p>Meanwhile this is what had happened to the wife.
After she had plunged into the lake, she found herself
in the hold of a water-tiger, who drew her to
the bottom. There she found a lodge, and all things
in it as if arranged for her reception, and she became
the water-tiger&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>Whilst the orphan boy and the child were playing
on the shore of the lake one day, the boy began to
throw pebbles into the water, when suddenly a gull
arose from the centre of the lake, and flew towards
the land. When it had arrived there, it took human
shape, and the boy recognised that it was the lost
mother. She had a leather belt around her, and
another belt of white metal. She suckled the baby,
and, preparing to return to the water, said to the
boy&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here with the child whenever it cries, and
I will nurse it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy carried the child home, and told the
father what had occurred. When the child cried
again, the man went with the boy to the shore, and
hid himself behind a clump of trees. Soon the gull
made its appearance, with a long shining chain
attached to it. The bird came to the shore, assumed
the mother&rsquo;s shape, and began to suckle the child.
The husband stood with his spear in his hand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
wondering what he had best do to regain his wife.
When he saw her preparing to return to the lake
he rushed forward, struck the shining chain with his
spear, and broke it. Then he took his wife and
child home. As he entered the lodge the old
woman looked up, and, when she saw the wife, she
dropped her head in despair. A rustling was heard
in the place; the next moment the old woman leaped
up, flew out of the lodge, and was never heard of
more.</p>

<h2>THE FIRE PLUME.</h2>


<p>Wassamo was living with his parents on the shores
of a large bay on the east coast of Lake Michigan.
It was at a period when nature spontaneously furnished
everything that was wanted, when the
Indians used skins for clothing, and flints for arrow
heads. It was long before the time that the flag of
the white man had first been seen in these lakes, or
the sound of an iron axe had been heard. The
skill of our people supplied them with weapons to
kill game, with instruments to procure bark for their
canoes, and they knew to dress and cook their victuals.</p>

<p>One day, when the season had commenced for
fish to be plentiful near the shore of the lake,
Wassamo&rsquo;s mother said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, I wish you would go to yonder point,
and see if you cannot procure me some fish. You
may ask your cousin to accompany you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did so. They set out, and, in the course of
the afternoon, arrived at the fishing-ground. His
cousin attended to the nets, for he was grown up to
manhood, but Wassamo had not yet reached that
age. They put their nets in the water, and encamped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
near them, using only a few pieces of birch-bark for
a lodge to shelter them at night. They lit a fire, and,
while they were conversing together, the moon
arose. Not a breath of wind disturbed the smooth
and bright surface of the lake. Not a cloud was
seen. Wassamo looked out on the water towards
their nets, and saw that almost all the floats had
disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us visit our nets. Perhaps
we are fortunate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did so, and were rejoiced, as they drew them
up, to see the meshes white here and there with
fish. They landed in good spirits, and put away
their canoe in safety from the winds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wassamo,&rdquo; said his cousin, &ldquo;you cook that we
may eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wassamo set about it immediately, and soon got
his kettle on the flames, while his cousin was lying at
his ease on the opposite side of the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said Wassamo, &ldquo;tell me stories, or sing
me some love-songs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other obeyed, and sang his plaintive songs.
He would frequently break off, and tell parts of
stories, and would then sing again, as suited his
feelings or fancy. While thus employed, he unconsciously
fell asleep. Wassamo had scarcely noticed
it in his care to watch the kettle, and, when the fish
were done, he took the kettle off. He spoke to his
cousin, but received no answer. He took the wooden
ladle to skim off the oil, for the fish were very fat.
He had a flambeau of twisted bark in one hand to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
give light; but, when he came to take out the fish,
he did not know how to manage to hold the light, so
he took off his garters, and tied them tight round
his head, and then placed the lighted flambeau above
his forehead, so that it was firmly held by the
bandage, and threw its light brilliantly about him.
Having both hands thus at liberty, he began to take
out the fish. Suddenly he heard a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;some one is near us. Awake,
and let us look out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His cousin, however, continued asleep. Again
Wassamo heard the laughter, and, looking, he beheld
two beautiful girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awake, awake,&rdquo; said he to his cousin. &ldquo;Here
are two young women;&rdquo; but he received no answer,
for his cousin was locked in his deepest slumbers.</p>

<p>Wassamo started up and advanced to the strange
women. He was about to speak to them, when he
fell senseless to the earth.</p>

<p>A short while after his cousin awoke. He looked
around and called Wassamo, but could not find
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Netawis, Netawis (Cousin, cousin)!&rdquo; he cried;
but there was no answer. He searched the woods
and all the shores around, but could not find him.
He did not know what to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although,&rdquo; he reasoned, &ldquo;his parents are my
relations, and they know he and I were great
friends, they will not believe me if I go home and
say that he is lost. They will say that I killed him,
and will require blood for blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
However, he resolved to return home, and, arriving
there, he told them what had occurred. Some
said, &ldquo;He has killed him treacherously,&rdquo; others said,
&ldquo;It is impossible. They were like brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Search was made on every side, and when at
length it became certain that Wassamo was not to
be found, his parents demanded the life of Netawis.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what had happened to Wassamo?
When he recovered his senses, he found himself
stretched on a bed in a spacious lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stranger,&rdquo; said some one, &ldquo;awake, and take
something to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking around him he saw many people, and an
old spirit man, addressing him, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughters saw you at the fishing-ground,
and brought you here. I am the guardian spirit of
Nagow Wudjoo (the sand mountains). We will
make your visit here agreeable, and if you will
remain I will give you one of my daughters in
marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man consented to the match, and remained
for some time with the spirit of the sand-hills
in his lodge at the bottom of the lake, for
there was it situated. At last, however, approached
the season of sleep, when the spirit and his relations
lay down for their long rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Son-in-law,&rdquo; said the old spirit, &ldquo;you can now,
in a few days, start with your wife to visit your
relations. You can be absent one year, but after
that you must return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wassamo promised to obey, and set out with his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
wife. When he was near his village, he left her in
a thicket and advanced alone. As he did so, who
should he meet but his cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Netawis, Netawis,&rdquo; cried his cousin, &ldquo;you have
come just in time to save me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he ran off to the lodge of Wassamo&rsquo;s
parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen him,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whom you accuse
me of having killed. He will be here in a few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the village was soon in a bustle, and Wassamo
and his wife excited universal attention, and the
people strove who should entertain them best. So
the time passed happily till the season came that
Wassamo and his wife should return to the spirits.
Netawis accompanied them to the shores of the
lake, and would have gone with them to their
strange abode, but Wassamo sent him back. With
him Wassamo took offerings from the Indians to his
father-in-law.</p>

<p>The old spirit was delighted to see the two return,
and he was also much pleased with the
presents Wassamo brought. He told his son-in-law
that he and his wife should go once more to visit
his people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is merely,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to assure them of my
friendship, and to bid them farewell for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some time afterwards Wassamo and his wife
made this visit. Having delivered his message, he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must now bid you all farewell for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
His parents and friends raised their voices in loud
lamentation, and they accompanied him and his wife
to the sand-banks to see them take their departure.</p>

<p>The day was mild, the sky clear, not a cloud
appeared, nor was there a breath of wind to disturb
the bright surface of the water. The most perfect
silence reigned throughout the company. They
gazed intently upon Wassamo and his wife as they
waded out into the water, waving their hands.
They saw them go into deeper and deeper water.
They saw the wave close over their heads. All at
once they raised a loud and piercing wail. They
looked again. A red flame, as if the sun had
glanced on a billow, marked the spot for an instant;
but the Feather-of-Flames and his wife had disappeared
for ever.</p>

<h2>THE JOURNEY TO THE ISLAND OF SOULS.</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there lived in the nation of the
Chippeways a most beautiful maiden, the flower of
the wilderness, the delight and wonder of all who
saw her. She was called the Rock-rose, and was
beloved by a youthful hunter, whose advances gained
her affection. No one was like the brave Outalissa
in her eyes: his deeds were the greatest, his skill
was the most wonderful. It was not permitted
them, however, to become the inhabitants of one
lodge. Death came to the flower of the Chippeways.
In the morning of her days she died, and her body
was laid in the dust with the customary rites of
burial. All mourned for her, but Outalissa was a
changed man. No more did he find delight in the
chase or on the war-path. He grew sad, shunned
the society of his brethren. He stood motionless as
a tree in the hour of calm, as the wave that is
frozen up by the breath of the cold wind.</p>

<p>Joy came no more to him. He told his discontent
in the ears of his people, and spoke of his
determination to seek his beloved maiden. She had
but removed, he said, as the birds fly away at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
approach of winter, and it required but due diligence
on his part to find her. Having prepared
himself, as a hunter makes ready for a long journey,
he armed himself with his war-spear and bow and
arrow, and set out to the Land of Souls.</p>

<p>Directed by the old tradition of his fathers, he
travelled south to reach that region, leaving behind
him the great star. As he moved onwards, he
found a more pleasant region succeeding to that in
which he had lived. Daily, hourly, he remarked
the change. The ice grew thinner, the air warmer,
the trees taller. Birds, such as he had never seen
before, sang in the bushes, and fowl of many kinds
were pluming themselves in the warm sun on the
shores of the lake. The gay woodpecker was tapping
the hollow beech, the swallow and the martin
were skimming along the level of the green vales.
He heard no more the cracking of branches beneath
the weight of icicles and snow, he saw no more the
spirits of departed men dancing wild dances on the
skirts of the northern clouds, and the farther he
travelled the milder grew the skies, the longer was
the period of the sun&rsquo;s stay upon the earth, and the
softer, though less brilliant, the light of the moon.</p>

<p>Noting these changes as he went with a joyful
heart, for they were indications of his near approach
to the land of joy and delight, he came at length to
a cabin situated on the brow of a steep hill in the
middle of a narrow road. At the door of this cabin
stood a man of a most ancient and venerable appearance.
He was bent nearly double with age.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
His locks were white as snow. His eyes were sunk
very far into his head, and the flesh was wasted
from his bones, till they were like trees from which
the bark has been peeled. He was clothed in a robe
of white goat&rsquo;s skin, and a long staff supported his
tottering limbs whithersoever he walked.</p>

<p>The Chippeway began to tell him who he was, and
why he had come thither, but the aged man stopped
him, telling him he knew upon what errand he was
bent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A short while before,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there passed
the soul of a tender and lovely maiden, well-known
to the son of the Red Elk, on her way
to the beautiful island. She was fatigued with her
long journey, and rested a while in this cabin. She
told me the story of your love, and was persuaded
that you would attempt to follow her to the Lake of
Spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man, further, told Outalissa that if he
made speed he might hope to overtake the maiden
on the way. Before, however, he resumed his
journey he must leave behind him his body, his
spear, bow, and arrows, which the old man promised
to keep for him should he return. The Chippeway
left his body and arms behind him, and under the
direction of the old man entered upon the road to
the Blissful Island. He had travelled but a couple
of bowshots when it met his view, even more beautiful
than his fathers had painted it.</p>

<p>He stood upon the brow of a hill which sloped
gently down to the water of a lake which stretched
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
as far as eye could see. Upon its banks were groves
of beautiful trees of all kinds, and many canoes were
to be seen gliding over its water. Afar, in the
centre of the lake, lay the beautiful island appointed
for the residence of the good. He walked down to
the shore and entered a canoe which stood ready for
him, made of a shining white stone. Seizing the
paddle, he pushed off from the shore and commenced
to make his way to the island. As he did so, he
came to a canoe like his own, in which he found her
whom he was in pursuit of. She recognised him, and
the two canoes glided side by side over the water.
Then Outalissa knew that he was on the Water of
Judgment, the great water over which every soul
must pass to reach the beautiful island, or in which
it must sink to meet the punishment of the wicked.
The two lovers glided on in fear, for the water
seemed at times ready to swallow them, and around
them they could see many canoes, which held those
whose lives had been wicked, going down. The
Master of Life had, however, decreed that they
should pass in safety, and they reached the shores of
the beautiful island, on which they landed full of joy.</p>

<p>It is impossible to tell the delights with which
they found it filled. Mild and soft winds, clear and
sweet waters, cool and refreshing shades, perpetual
verdure, inexhaustible fertility, met them on all sides.
Gladly would the son of the Red Elk have remained
for ever with his beloved in the happy island, but
the words of the Master of Life came to him in the
pauses of the breeze, saying&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
&ldquo;Go back to thy own land, hunter. Your time
has not yet come. You have not yet performed the
work I have for you to do, nor can you yet enjoy
those pleasures which belong to them who have
performed their allotted task on earth. Go back,
then. In time thou shalt rejoin her, the love of
whom has brought thee hither.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>MACHINITOU, THE EVIL SPIRIT.</h2>


<p>Chemanitou, being the Master of Life, at one
time became the origin of a spirit that has ever
since caused him and all others of his creation a
great deal of disquiet. His birth was owing to an
accident. It was in this wise:&mdash;</p>

<p>Metowac, or as the white people now call it,
Long Island, was originally a vast plain, so level and
free from any kind of growth that it looked like a
portion of the great sea that had suddenly been
made to move back and let the sand below appear,
which was, in fact, the case.</p>

<p>Here it was that Chemanitou used to come and
sit when he wished to bring any new creation to
life. The place being spacious and solitary, the
water upon every side, he had not only room enough,
but was free from interruption.</p>

<p>It is well known that some of these early creations
were of very great size, so that very few could live
in the same place, and their strength made it
difficult for even Chemanitou to control them, for
when he has given them certain powers they have
the use of the laws that govern those powers, till
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
it is his will to take them back to himself. Accordingly
it was the custom of Chemanitou, when he
wished to try the effect of these creatures, to set
them in motion upon the island of Metowac, and if
they did not please him, he took the life away from
them again. He would set up a mammoth, or other
large animal, in the centre of the island, and build
it up with great care, somewhat in the manner that
a cabin or a canoe is made.</p>

<p>Even to this day may be found traces of what
had been done here in former years, and the manner
in which the earth sometimes sinks down shows that
this island is nothing more than a great cake of
earth, a sort of platter laid upon the sea for the
convenience of Chemanitou, who used it as a table
upon which he might work, never having designed
it for anything else, the margin of the Chatiemac
(the stately swan), or Hudson river, being better
adapted to the purposes of habitation.</p>

<p>When the Master of Life wished to build up an
elephant or mammoth, he placed four cakes of clay
upon the ground, at proper distances, which were
moulded into shape, and became the feet of the
animal.</p>

<p>Now sometimes these were left unfinished, and to
this day the green tussocks to be seen like little
islands about the marshes show where these cakes
of clay were placed.</p>

<p>As Chemanitou went on with his work, the
Neebanawbaigs (or water-spirits), the Puck-wud-jinnies
(little men who vanish), and, indeed, all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
lesser manitoes, used to come and look on, and
wonder what it would be, and how it would act.</p>

<p>When the animal was completed, and had dried
a long time in the sun, Chemanitou opened a place
in the side, and, entering in, remained there many
days.</p>

<p>When he came forth the creature began to shiver
and sway from side to side, in such a manner as
shook the whole island for leagues. If its appearance
pleased the Master of Life it was suffered to
depart, and it was generally found that these
animals plunged into the open sea upon the north
side of the island, and disappeared in the great
forests beyond.</p>

<p>Now at one time Chemanitou was a very long
time building an animal of such great bulk that it
looked like a mountain upon the centre of the island,
and all the manitoes from all parts came to see
what it was. The Puck-wud-jinnies especially made
themselves very merry, capering behind its great
ears, sitting within its mouth, each perched upon a
tooth, and running in and out of the sockets of the
eyes, thinking Chemanitou, who was finishing off
other parts of the animal, would not see them.</p>

<p>But he can see right through everything he has
made. He was glad to see the Puck-wud-jinnies
so lively, and he bethought him of many new creations
while he watched their motions.</p>

<p>When the Master of Life had completed this large
animal, he was fearful to give it life, and so it was
left upon the island, or work-table of Chemanitou,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
till its great weight caused it to break through, and,
sinking partly down, it stuck fast, the head and tail
holding it in such a manner as to prevent it slipping
further down.</p>

<p>Chemanitou then lifted up a piece of the back, and
found it made a very good cavity, into which the old
creations which failed to please him might be thrown.</p>

<p>He sometimes amused himself by making creatures
very small and active, with which he disported
awhile, and finding them of very little use in the
world, and not so attractive as the little vanishers,
he would take out the life, taking it to himself, and
then cast them into the cave made in the body of
the unfinished animal.</p>

<p>In this way great quantities of very odd shapes
were heaped together in this Roncomcomon, or Place
of Fragments.</p>

<p>He was always careful before casting a thing he
had created aside to take out the life.</p>

<p>One day the Master of Life took two pieces of clay
and moulded them into two large feet, like those of
a panther. He did not make four&mdash;there were two
only.</p>

<p>He put his own feet into them, and found the
tread very light and springy, so that he might go
with great speed and yet make no noise.</p>

<p>Next he built up a pair of very tall legs, in the
shape of his own, and made them walk about a while.
He was pleased with the motion. Then followed a
round body covered with large scales, like those of
the alligator.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
He now found the figure doubling forward, and
he fastened a long black snake, that was gliding by,
to the back part of the body, and wound the other
end round a sapling which grew near, and this held
the body upright, and made a very good tail.</p>

<p>The shoulders were broad and strong, like those of
the buffalo, and covered with hair. The neck thick
and short, and full at the back.</p>

<p>Thus far Chemanitou had worked with little
thought, but when he came to the head he thought
a long while.</p>

<p>He took a round ball of clay into his lap, and
worked it over with great care. While he thought,
he patted the ball of clay upon the top, which made
it very broad and low, for Chemanitou was thinking
of the panther feet and the buffalo neck. He
remembered the Puck-wud-jinnies playing in the
eye sockets of the great unfinished animal, and he
bethought him to set the eyes out, like those of
a lobster, so that the animal might see on every
side.</p>

<p>He made the forehead broad and full, but low, for
here was to be the wisdom of the forked tongue,
like that of the serpent, which should be in its
mouth. It should see all things and know all
things. Here Chemanitou stopped, for he saw that
he had never thought of such a creation before, one
with two feet&mdash;a creature that should stand upright,
and see upon every side.</p>

<p>The jaws were very strong, with ivory teeth and
gills upon either side, which rose and fell whenever
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
breath passed through them. The nose was like
the beak of the vulture. A tuft of porcupine-quills
made the scalp lock.</p>

<p>Chemanitou held the head out the length of his
arm, and turned it first upon one side and then upon
the other. He passed it rapidly through the air, and
saw the gills rise and fall, the lobster eyes whirl
round, and the vulture nose look keen.</p>

<p>Chemanitou became very sad, yet he put the head
upon the shoulders. It was the first time he had
made an upright figure. It seemed to be the first
idea of a man.</p>

<p>It was now nearly right. The bats were flying
through the air, and the roar of wild beasts began
to be heard. A gusty wind swept in from the ocean
and passed over the island of Metowac, casting the
light sand to and fro. A wavy scud was skimming
along the horizon, while higher up in the sky was a
dark thick cloud, upon the verge of which the moon
hung for a moment and was then shut in.</p>

<p>A panther came by and stayed a moment, with
one foot raised and bent inward, while it looked
up at the image and smelt the feet that were like
its own.</p>

<p>A vulture swooped down with a great noise of
its wings, and made a dash at the beak, but Chemanitou
held it back.</p>

<p>Then came the porcupine, the lizard, and the
snake, each drawn by its kind in the image.</p>

<p>Chemanitou veiled his face for many hours, and
the gusty wind swept by, but he did not stir.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
He saw that every beast of the earth seeks its
kind, and that which is like draws its likeness to
itself.</p>

<p>The Master of Life thought and thought. The
idea grew into his mind that at some time he would
create a creature who should be made, not after the
things of the earth, but after himself.</p>

<p>The being should link this world to the spirit
world, being made in the likeness of the Great
Spirit, he should be drawn unto his likeness.</p>

<p>Many days and nights&mdash;whole seasons&mdash;passed
while Chemanitou thought upon these things. He
saw all things.</p>

<p>Then the Master of Life lifted up his head. The
stars were looking down upon the image, and a bat
had alighted upon the forehead, spreading its great
wings upon each side. Chemanitou took the bat
and held out its whole leathery wings (and ever
since the bat, when he rests, lets his body hang
down), so that he could try them over the head of
the image. He then took the life of the bat away,
and twisted off the body, by which means the whole
thin part fell down over the head of the image and
upon each side, making the ears, and a covering for
the forehead like that of the hooded serpent.</p>

<p>Chemanitou did not cut off the face of the image
below, but went on and made a chin and lips that
were firm and round, that they might shut in the
forked tongue and ivory teeth, and he knew that
with the lips the image would smile when life should
be given to it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
The image was now complete save for the arms,
and Chemanitou saw that it was necessary it should
have hands. He grew more grave.</p>

<p>He had never given hands to any creature. He
made the arms and the hands very beautiful, after
the manner of his own.</p>

<p>Chemanitou now took no pleasure in the work he
had done. It was not good in his sight.</p>

<p>He wished he had not given it hands. Might it
not, when trusted with life, create? Might it not
thwart the plans of the Master of Life himself?</p>

<p>He looked long at the image. He saw what it
would do when life should be given it. He knew all
things.</p>

<p>He now put fire in the image, but fire is not
life.</p>

<p>He put fire within and a red glow passed through
and through it. The fire dried the clay of which the
image was made, and gave the image an exceedingly
fierce aspect. It shone through the scales upon
the breast, through the gills, and the bat-winged
ears. The lobster eyes were like a living coal.</p>

<p>Chemanitou opened the side of the image, but he
did not enter. He had given it hands and a chin.</p>

<p>It could smile like the manitoes themselves.</p>

<p>He made it walk all about the island of Metowac,
that he might see how it would act. This he did by
means of his will.</p>

<p>He now put a little life into it, but he did not
take out the fire. Chemanitou saw the aspect of the
creature would be very terrible, and yet that it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
could smile in such a manner that it ceased to be
ugly. He thought much upon these things. He
felt that it would not be best to let such a creature
live&mdash;a creature made up mostly from the beasts of
the field, but with hands of power, a chin lifting the
head upward, and lips holding all things within
themselves.</p>

<p>While he thought upon these things he took the
image in his hands and cast it into the cave. But
Chemanitou forgot to take out the life.</p>

<p>The creature lay a long time in the cave and did
not stir, for its fall was very great. It lay amongst
the old creations that had been thrown in there
without life.</p>

<p>Now when a long time had passed Chemanitou
heard a great noise in the cave. He looked in and
saw the image sitting there, and it was trying to
put together the old broken things that had been
cast in as of no value.</p>

<p>Chemanitou gathered together a vast heap of
stones and sand, for large rocks are not to be had
upon the island, and stopped the mouth of the cave.
Many days passed and the noise within the cave
grew louder. The earth shook, and hot smoke came
from the ground. The manitoes crowded to Metowac
to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>Chemanitou came also, for he remembered the
image he had cast in there of which he had forgotten
to take away the life.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a great rising of the stones
and sand, the sky grew black with wind and dust.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Fire played about on the ground, and water gushed
high into the air.</p>

<p>All the manitoes fled with fear, and the image
came forth with a great noise and most terrible to
behold. Its life had grown strong within it, for
the fire had made it very fierce.</p>

<p>Everything fled before it and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Machinitou! machinitou,&rdquo; which means a god,
but an evil god.</p>

<h2>THE WOMAN OF STONE.</h2>


<p>In one of the niches or recesses formed by a precipice
in the cavern of Kickapoo Creek, which is a
tributary of the Wisconsin, there is a gigantic mass
of stone presenting the appearance of a human figure.
It is so sheltered by the overhanging rocks and by
the sides of the recess in which it stands as to
assume a dark and gloomy character. Of the figure
the following legend is related:&mdash;</p>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a woman who was
called Shenanska, or the White Buffalo Robe. She
was an inhabitant of the prairie, a dweller in the
cabins which stand upon the verge of the hills. She
was the pride of her people, not only for her beauty,
which was very great, but for her goodness. The
breath of the summer wind was not milder than the
temper of Shenanska, the face of the sun was not
fairer than her countenance.</p>

<p>At length the tribe was surprised in its encampment
on the banks of the Kickapoo by a numerous
band of the fierce Mengwe. Many of them fell
fighting bravely, the greater part of the women and
children were made prisoners, and the others fled to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the wilds for safety. It was the fortune of Shenanska
to escape from death or captivity. When the alarm
of the war-whoop reached her ear as she was sleeping
in her lodge with her husband, she had rushed forth
with him and gone with the braves to meet their
assailants. When she saw half of the men of her
nation lying dead around, then she fled. She had
been wounded in the battle, but she still succeeded
in effecting her escape to the hills. Weakened by
loss of blood, she had not strength enough left to
hunt for a supply of food, and she was near perishing
with hunger.</p>

<p>While she lay beneath the shade of a tree there
came to her a being not of this world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shenanska,&rdquo; said he, in a gentle voice, &ldquo;thou art
wounded and hungry, shall I heal thee and feed thee?
Wilt thou return to the lands of thy tribe and live
to be old, a widow and alone, or go now to the land
of departed spirits and join the shade of thy husband?
The choice is thine. If thou wilt live,
crippled, and bowed down by wounds and disease,
thou mayest. If it would please thee better to rejoin
thy friends in the country beyond the Great River,
say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shenanska replied that she wished to die. The
spirit took her, and placed her in one of the recesses
of the cavern, overshadowed by hanging rocks. He
then spoke some words in a low voice, and, breathing
on her, she became stone. Determined that a woman
so good and beautiful should not be forgotten by
the world, he made her into a statue, to which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
gave the power of killing suddenly any one who irreverently
approached it. For a long time the statue
relentlessly exercised this power. Many an unconscious
Indian, venturing too near to it, fell dead
without any perceptible wound. At length, tired of
the havoc the statue made, the guardian spirit took
away the power he had given to it. At this day
the statue may be approached with safety, but the
Indians hold it in fear, not intruding rashly upon it,
and when in its presence treating it with great
respect.</p>

<h2>THE MAIDEN WHO LOVED A FISH.</h2>


<p>There was once among the Marshpees, a small
tribe who have their hunting-grounds on the shores
of the Great Lake, near the Cape of Storms, a
woman whose name was Awashanks. She was
rather silly, and very idle. For days together she
would sit doing nothing. Then she was so ugly and
ill-shaped that not one of the youths of the village
would have aught to say to her by way of courtship
or marriage. She squinted very much; her face was
long and thin, her nose excessively large and humped,
her teeth crooked and projecting, her chin almost as
sharp as the bill of a loon, and her ears as large as
those of a deer. Altogether she was a very odd and
strangely formed woman, and wherever she went
she never failed to excite much laughter and derision
among those who thought that ugliness and deformity
were fit subjects for ridicule.</p>

<p>Though so very ugly, there was one faculty she
possessed in a more remarkable degree than any
woman of the tribe. It was that of singing. Nothing,
unless such could be found in the land of
spirits, could equal the sweetness of her voice or the
beauty of her songs. Her favourite place of resort
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
was a small hill, a little removed from the river of
her people, and there, seated beneath the shady trees,
she would while away the hours of summer with her
charming songs. So beautiful and melodious were
the things she uttered, that, by the time she had sung
a single sentence, the branches above her head would
be filled with the birds that came thither to listen,
the thickets around her would be crowded with
beasts, and the waters rolling beside her would be
alive with fishes, all attracted by the sweet sounds.
From the minnow to the porpoise, from the wren to
the eagle, from the snail to the lobster, from the
mouse to the mole,&mdash;all hastened to the spot to listen
to the charming songs of the hideous Marshpee
maiden.</p>

<p>Among the fishes which repaired every night to the
vicinity of the Little Hillock, which was the chosen
resting-place of the ugly songstress, was the great
chief of the trouts, a tribe of fish inhabiting the river
near by. The chief was of a far greater size than the
people of his nation usually are, being as long as a
man, and quite as thick.</p>

<p>Of all the creatures which came to listen to the
singing of Awashanks none appeared to enjoy it so
highly as the chief of the trouts. As his bulk prevented
him from approaching so near as he wished,
he, from time to time, in his eagerness to enjoy the
music to the best advantage, ran his nose into the
ground, and thus worked his way a considerable distance
into the land. Nightly he continued his exertions
to approach the source of the delightful sounds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
he heard, till at length he had ploughed out a wide
and handsome channel, and so effected his passage
from the river to the hill, a distance extending an
arrow&rsquo;s-flight. Thither he repaired every night at
the commencement of darkness, sure to meet the
maiden who had become so necessary to his happiness.
Soon he began to speak of the pleasure he
enjoyed, and to fill the ears of Awashanks with fond
protestations of his love and affection. Instead of
singing to him, she soon began to listen to his voice.
It was something so new and strange to her to hear
the tones of love and courtship, a thing so unusual
to be told she was beautiful, that it is not wonderful
her head was turned by the new incident, and that
she began to think the voice of her lover the
sweetest she had ever heard. One thing marred
their happiness. This was that the trout could not
live upon land, nor the maiden in the water. This
state of things gave them much sorrow.</p>

<p>They had met one evening at the usual place, and
were discoursing together, lamenting that two who
loved one another so should be doomed to always
live apart, when a man appeared close to Awashanks.
He asked the lovers why they seemed to be so
sad.</p>

<p>The chief of the trouts told the stranger the cause
of their sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be not grieved nor hopeless,&rdquo; said the stranger,
when the chief had finished. &ldquo;The impediments
can be removed. I am the spirit who presides over
fishes, and though I cannot make a man or woman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
of a fish, I can make them into fish. Under my
power Awashanks shall become a beautiful trout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he bade the girl follow him into the
river. When they had waded in some little depth
he took up some water in his hand and poured it on
her head, muttering some words, of which none but
himself knew the meaning. Immediately a change
took place in her. Her body took the form of a
fish, and in a few moments she was a complete
trout. Having accomplished this transformation the
spirit gave her to the chief of the trouts, and the
pair glided off into the deep and quiet waters. She
did not, however, forget the land of her birth. Every
season, on the same night as that upon which her
disappearance from her tribe had been wrought,
there were to be seen two trouts of enormous size
playing in the water off the shore. They continued
these visits till the pale-faces came to the country,
when, deeming themselves to be in danger from a
people who paid no reverence to the spirits of the
land, they bade it adieu for ever.</p>

<h2>THE LONE LIGHTNING.</h2>


<p>A little orphan boy, who had no one to care for
him, once lived with his uncle, who treated him very
badly, making him do hard work, and giving him
very little to eat, so that the boy pined away and
never grew much, but became, through hard usage,
very thin and light. At last the uncle pretended to
be ashamed of this treatment, and determined to
make amends for it by fattening the boy up. He
really wished, however, to kill him by overfeeding
him. He told his wife to give the boy plenty of
bear&rsquo;s meat, and let him have the fat, which is
thought to be the best part. They were both very
assiduous in cramming him, and one day nearly
choked him to death by forcing the fat down his
throat. The boy escaped, and fled from the lodge.
He knew not where to go, and wandered about.
When night came on he was afraid the wild beasts
would eat him, so he climbed up into the forks of
a high pine-tree, and there he fell asleep in the
branches.</p>

<p>As he was asleep a person appeared to him from
the high sky, and said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
&ldquo;My poor lad, I pity you, and the bad usage you
have received from your uncle has led me to visit
you. Follow me, and step in my tracks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately his sleep left him, and he rose up and
followed his guide, mounting up higher and higher in
the air until he reached the lofty sky. Here twelve
arrows were put into his hands, and he was told
that there were a great many manitoes in the northern
sky, against whom he must go to war and try to
waylay and shoot them. Accordingly he went to
that part of the sky, and, at long intervals, shot
arrow after arrow until he had expended eleven in a
vain attempt to kill the manitoes. At the flight of
each arrow there was a long and solitary streak of
lightning in the sky&mdash;then all was clear again, and
not a cloud or spot could be seen. The twelfth
arrow he held a long time in his hands, and looked
around keenly on every side to spy the manitoes he
was after, but these manitoes were very cunning, and
could change their form in a moment. All they
feared was the boy&rsquo;s arrows, for these were magic
weapons, which had been given to him by a good
spirit, and had power to kill if aimed aright. At
length the boy drew up his last arrow, took aim,
and let fly, as he thought, into the very heart
of the chief of the manitoes. Before the arrow
reached him, however, he changed himself into
a rock, into which the head of the arrow sank deep
and stuck fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now your gifts are all expended,&rdquo; cried the
enraged manito, &ldquo;and I will make an example of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
your audacity and pride of heart for lifting your
bow against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he transformed the boy into the
Nazhik-a-w&auml; w&auml; sun, or Lone Lightning, which
may be observed in the northern sky to this
day.</p>

<h2>AGGO-DAH-GAUDA.</h2>


<p>Aggo-dah-gauda had one leg hooped up to his thigh
so that he was obliged to get along by hopping. He
had a beautiful daughter, and his chief care was to
secure her from being carried off by the king of the
buffaloes. He was peculiar in his habits, and lived
in a loghouse, and he advised his daughter to keep
indoors, and never go out for fear she should be
stolen away.</p>

<p>One sunshiny morning Aggo-dah-gauda prepared
to go out fishing, but before he left the lodge he
reminded his daughter of her strange lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am going out to fish,
and as the day will be a pleasant one, you must
recollect that we have an enemy near who is constantly
going about, and so you must not leave the
lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he reached his fishing-place, he heard a
voice singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Man with the leg tied up,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Man with the leg tied up,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Broken leg&mdash;leg&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Legged.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He looked round but saw no one, so he suspected
the words were sung by his enemies the buffaloes,
and hastened home.</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s father had not been long absent from
the lodge when she began to think to herself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hard to be for ever kept indoors. The
spring is coming on, and the days are so sunny and
warm, that it would be very pleasant to sit out of
doors. My father says it is dangerous. I know what
I will do: I will get on the top of the house, and
there I can comb and dress my hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She accordingly got up on the roof of the small
house, and busied herself in untying and combing
her beautiful hair, which was not only fine and
shining, but so long that it reached down to the
ground, hanging over the eaves of the house as she
combed it. She was so intent upon this that she
forgot all ideas of danger. All of a sudden the king
of the buffaloes came dashing by with his herd of
followers, and, taking her between his horns, away
he cantered over the plains, and then, plunging into
a river that bounded his land, he carried her safely
to his lodge on the other side. Here he paid her
every attention in order to gain her affections, but
all to no purpose, for she sat pensive and disconsolate
in the lodge among the other females, and scarcely
ever spoke. The buffalo king did all he could to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
please her, and told the others in the lodge to give
her everything she wanted, and to study her in
every way. They set before her the choicest food,
and gave her the seat of honour in the lodge. The
king himself went out hunting to obtain the most
delicate bits of meat both of animals and wild-fowl,
and, not content with these proofs of his love, he
fasted himself and would often take his pib-be-gwun
(Indian flute) and sit near the lodge singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;My sweetheart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sweetheart,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ah me!<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Ah me!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the meantime Aggo-dah-gauda came home, and
finding his daughter had been stolen he determined
to get her back. For this purpose he immediately
set out. He could easily trace the king till he came
to the banks of the river, and then he saw he had
plunged in and swum over. When Aggo-dah-gauda
came to the river, however, he found it covered with
a thin coating of ice, so that he could not swim
across nor walk over. He therefore determined to
wait on the bank a day or two till the ice might
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
melt or become strong enough to bear him. Very
soon the ice was strong enough, and Aggo-dah-gauda
crossed over. On the other side, as he went along,
he found branches torn off and cast down, and these
had been strewn thus by his daughter to aid him in
following her. The way in which she managed it
was this. Her hair was all untied when she was
captured, and as she was carried along it caught in
the branches as she passed, so she took the pieces
out of her hair and threw them down on the path.</p>

<p>When Aggo-dah-gauda came to the king&rsquo;s lodge
it was evening. Carefully approaching it, he peeped
through the sides and saw his daughter sitting there
disconsolately. She saw him, and knowing that it
was her father come for her, she said to the king,
giving him a tender glance&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go and get you a drink of water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king was delighted at what he thought was a
mark of her affection, and the girl left the lodge
with a dipper in her hand. The king waited a long
time for her, and as she did not return he went out
with his followers, but nothing could be seen or
heard of the girl. The buffaloes sallied out into the
plains, and had not gone far by the light of the
moon, when they were attacked by a party of
hunters. Many of them fell, but the buffalo-king,
being stronger and swifter than the others, escaped,
and, flying to the west, was never seen more.</p>

<h2>PIQUA.</h2>


<p>A great while ago the Shawanos nation took up
the war-talk against the Walkullas, who lived on
their own lands on the borders of the Great Salt
Lake, and near the Burning Water. Part of the
nation were not well pleased with the war. The
head chief and the counsellors said the Walkullas
were very brave and cunning, and the priests said
their god was mightier than ours. The old and
experienced warriors said the counsellors were wise,
and had spoken well; but the Head Buffalo, the young
warriors, and all who wished for war, would not
listen to their words. They said that our fathers
had beaten their fathers in many battles, that the
Shawanos were as brave and strong as they ever
were, and the Walkullas much weaker and more
cowardly. They said the old and timid, the faint
heart and the failing knee, might stay at home to
take care of the women and children, and sleep and
dream of those who had never dared bend a bow or
look upon a painted cheek or listen to a war-whoop,
while the young warriors went to war and drank
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
much blood. When two moons were gone they said
they would come back with many prisoners and scalps,
and have a great feast. The arguments of the fiery
young men prevailed with all the youthful warriors,
but the elder and wiser listened to the priests and
counsellors, and remained in their villages to see
the leaf fall and the grass grow, and to gather in
the nut and follow the trail of the deer.</p>

<p>Two moons passed, then a third, then came the
night enlivened by many stars, but the warriors
returned not. As the land of the Walkullas lay but
a woman&rsquo;s journey of six suns from the villages of
our nation, our people began to fear that our young
men had been overcome in battle and were all slain.
The head chief, the counsellors, and all the warriors
who had remained behind, came together in the
great wigwam, and called the priests to tell them
where their sons were. Chenos, who was the wisest
of them all (as well he might be, for he was older
than the oak-tree whose top dies by the hand of
Time), answered that they were killed by their
enemies, the Walkullas, assisted by men of a
strange speech and colour, who lived beyond the
Great Salt Lake, fought with thunder and lightning,
and came to our enemies on the back of a great bird
with many white wings. When he had thus made
known to our people the fate of the warriors there was
a dreadful shout of horror throughout the village.
The women wept aloud, and the men sprang up and
seized their bows and arrows to go to war with the
Walkullas and the strange warriors who had helped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
to slay their sons, but Chenos bade them sit down
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one yet living,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He will
soon be here. The sound of his footsteps is in my
ear as he crosses the hollow hills. He has killed
many of his enemies; he has glutted his vengeance
fully; he has drunk blood in plenteous draughts.
Long he fought with the men of his own race, and
many fell before him, but he fled from the men who
came to the battle armed with the real lightning, and
hurling unseen death. Even now I see him coming;
the shallow streams he has forded; the deep rivers
he has swum. He is tired and hungry, and his
quiver has no arrows, but he brings a prisoner in
his arms. Lay the deer&rsquo;s flesh on the fire, and bring
hither the pounded corn. Taunt him not, for he is
valiant, and has fought like a hungry bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the wise Chenos spoke these words to the
grey-bearded counsellors and warriors the Head
Buffalo walked calm and cool into the midst of
them. There he stood, tall and straight as a young
pine, but he spoke no word, looking on the head
chief and the counsellors. There was blood upon
his body, dried on by the sun, and the arm next his
heart was bound up with the skin of the deer. His
eye was hollow and his body gaunt, as though he
had fasted long. His quiver held no arrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are our sons?&rdquo; inquired the head chief
of the warrior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask the wolf and the panther,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother! tell us where are our sons!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
exclaimed the chief. &ldquo;Our women ask us for their
sons. They want them. Where are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are the snows of last year?&rdquo; replied the
warrior. &ldquo;Have they not gone down the swelling
river into the Great Lake? They have, and even so
have your sons descended the stream of Time into
the great Lake of Death. The great star sees them
as they lie by the water of the Walkulla, but they
see him not. The panther and the wolf howl unheeded
at their feet, and the eagle screams, but they
hear them not. The vulture whets his beak on
their bones, the wild-cat rends their flesh, both are
unfelt, for your sons are dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the warrior told these things to our people,
they set up their loud death-howl. The women
wept; but the men sprang up and seized their
weapons, to go to meet the Walkullas, the slayers
of their sons. The chief warrior rose again&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fathers and warriors,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;hear me and
believe my words, for I will tell you the truth.
Who ever heard the Head Buffalo lie, and who ever
saw him afraid of his enemies? Never, since the
time that he chewed the bitter root and put on the
new moccasins, has he lied or fled from his foes.
He has neither a forked tongue nor a faint heart.
Fathers, the Walkullas are weaker than us. Their
arms are not so strong, their hearts are not so big,
as ours. As well might the timid deer make war
upon the hungry wolf, as the Walkullas upon the
Shawanos. We could slay them as easily as a hawk
pounces into a dove&rsquo;s nest and steals away her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
unfeathered little ones. The Head Buffalo alone could
have taken the scalps of half the nation. But a
strange tribe has come among them&mdash;men whose
skin is white as the folds of the cloud, and whose
hair shines like the great star of day. They do not
fight as we fight, with bows and arrows and with war-axes,
but with spears which thunder and lighten, and
send unseen death. The Shawanos fall before it as
the berries and acorns fall when the forest is shaken
by the wind in the beaver-moon. Look at the arm
nearest my heart. It was stricken by a bolt from
the strangers&rsquo; thunder; but he fell by the hands of
the Head Buffalo, who fears nothing but shame, and
his scalp lies at the feet of the head chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fathers, this was our battle. We came upon the
Walkullas, I and my brothers, when they were unprepared.
They were just going to hold the dance of the
green corn. The whole nation had come to the dance;
there were none left behind save the sick and the
very old. None were painted; they were all for peace,
and were as women. We crept close to them, and
hid in the thick bushes which grew upon the edge
of their camp, for the Shawanos are the cunning
adder and not the foolish rattlesnake. We saw
them preparing to offer a sacrifice to the Great
Spirit. We saw them clean the deer, and hang his
head, horns, and entrails upon the great white pole
with a forked top, which stood over the roof of the
council wigwam. They did not know that the
Master of Life had sent the Shawanos to mix blood
with the sacrifices. We saw them take the new corn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
and rub it upon their hands, breasts, and faces.
Then the head chief, having first thanked the
Master of Life for his goodness to the Walkullas,
got up and gave his brethren a talk. He told them
that the Great Spirit loved them, and had made
them victorious over all their enemies; that he had
sent a great many fat bears, deer, and moose to
their hunting-ground, and had given them fish,
whose heads were very small and bodies very big;
that he had made their corn grow tall and sweet,
and had ordered his suns to ripen it in the beginning
of the harvest moon, that they might make a
great feast for the strangers who had come from a
far country on the wings of a great bird to warm
themselves at the Walkullas&rsquo; fire. He told them
they must love the Great Spirit, take care of the
old men, tell no lies, and never break the faith of
the pipe of peace; that they must not harm the
strangers, for they were their brothers, but must
live in peace with them, and give them lands and
wives from among their women. If they did these
things the Great Spirit, he said, would make their
corn grow taller than ever, and direct them to
hunting-grounds where the moose should be as
thick as the stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fathers and warriors, we heard these words;
but we knew not what to do. We feared not the
Walkullas; the God of War, we saw, had given them
into our hands. But who were the strange tribe?
Were they armed as we were, and was their Great
Medicine (Great Spirit) like ours? Warriors, you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
all knew the Young Eagle, the son of the Old Eagle,
who is here with us; but his wings are feeble, he
flies no more to the field of blood. The Young
Eagle feared nothing but shame, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I see many men sit round a fire, I will go and
see who they are!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went. The Old Eagle looks at me as if he
would say, &lsquo;Why went not the chief warrior himself?&rsquo;
I will tell you. The Head Buffalo is a head
taller than the tallest man of his tribe. Can the
moose crawl into the fox&rsquo;s hole? Can the swan hide
himself under a little leaf? The Young Eagle
was little, save in his soul. He was not full-grown,
save in his heart. He could go and not be seen or
heard. He was the cunning black-snake which
creeps silently in the grass, and none thinks him
near till he strikes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came back and told us there were many
strange men a little way before us whose faces were
white, and who wore no skins, whose cabins were
white as the snow upon the Backbone of the Great
Spirit (the Alleghany Mountains), flat at the top,
and moving with the wind like the reeds on the
bank of a river; that they did not talk like the
Walkullas, but spoke a strange tongue, the like of
which he had never heard before. Many of our
warriors would have turned back to our own lands.
The Flying Squirrel said it was not cowardice to do
so; but the Head Buffalo never turns till he has
tasted the blood of his foes. The Young Eagle said
he had eaten the bitter root and put on the new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
moccasins, and had been made a man, and his father
and the warriors would cry shame on him if he took
no scalp. Both he and the Head Buffalo said they
would go and attack the Walkullas and their friends
alone. The young warriors then said they would
also go to the battle, and with a great heart, as their
fathers had done. Then the Shawanos rushed upon
their foes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Walkullas fell before us like rain in the
summer months. We were as a fire among rushes.
We went upon them when they were unprepared,
when they were as children; and for a while the
Great Spirit gave them into our hands. But a
power rose up against us that we could not withstand.
The strange men came upon us armed with
thunder and lightning. Why delays my tongue to
tell its story? Fathers, your sons have fallen like
the leaves of a forest-tree in a high wind, like the
flowers of spring after a frost, like drops of rain in
the sturgeon moon! Warriors, the sprouts which
sprang up from the withered oaks have perished,
the young braves of our nation lie food for the
eagle and the wild-cat by the arm of the Great
Lake!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fathers, the bolt from the strangers&rsquo; thunder
entered my flesh, yet I did not fly. These six scalps
I tore from the Walkullas, but this has yellow hair.
Have I done well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The head chief and the counsellors answered he
had done very well, but Chenos answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. You went into the Walkullas&rsquo; camp when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the tribe were feasting to the Great Spirit, and you
disturbed the sacrifice, and mixed human blood with
it. Therefore has this evil come upon us, for the
Great Spirit is very angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the head chief and the counsellors asked
Chenos what must be done to appease the Master of
Breath.</p>

<p>Chenos answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Head Buffalo, with the morning, will offer
to him that which he holds dearest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Head Buffalo looked upon the priests, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Head Buffalo fears the Great Spirit. He
will kill a deer, and, in the morning, it shall be
burned to the Great Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chenos said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have told the council how the battle was
fought and who fell; you have shown the spent
quiver and the scalps, but you have not spoken of
your prisoner. The Great Spirit keeps nothing hid
from his priests, of whom Chenos is one. He has
told me you have a prisoner, one with tender feet
and a trembling heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let any one say the Head Buffalo ever lied,&rdquo;
replied the warrior. &ldquo;He never spoke but truth.
He has a prisoner, a woman taken from the strange
camp, a daughter of the sun, a maiden from the
happy islands which no Shawano has ever seen, and
she shall live with me, and become the mother of
my children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; asked the head chief.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
&ldquo;She sits on the bank of the river at the bend
where we dug up the bones of the great beast,
beneath the tree which the Master of Breath shivered
with his lightnings. I placed her there because the
spot is sacred, and none dare disturb her. I will
go and fetch her to the council fire, but let no one
touch her or show anger, for she is fearful as a
young deer, and weeps like a child for its mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon he returned, and brought with him a woman.
She shook like a reed in the winter&rsquo;s wind, and
many tears ran down her cheeks. The men sat as
though their tongues were frozen. Was she beautiful?
Go forth to the forest when it is clothed with
the flowers of spring, look at the tall maize when it
waves in the wind, and ask if they are beautiful.
Her skin was white as the snow which falls upon
the mountains beyond our lands, save upon her
cheeks, where it was red,&mdash;not such red as the Indian
paints when he goes to war, but such as the Master
of Life gives to the flower which grows among thorns.
Her eyes shone like the star which never moves.
Her step was like that of the deer when it is a little
scared.</p>

<p>The Head Buffalo said to the council&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my prisoner. I fought hard for her.
Three warriors, tall, strong, and painted, three pale
men, armed with red lightning, stood at her side.
Where are they now? I bore her away in my arms,
for fear had overcome her. When night came on I
wrapped skins around her, and laid her under the
leafy branches of the tree to keep off the cold, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
kindled a fire, and watched by her till the sun rose.
Who will say she shall not live with the Head
Buffalo, and be the mother of his children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Old Eagle got up, but he could not
walk strong, for he was the oldest warrior of his
tribe, and had seen the flowers bloom many times,
the infant trees of the forest die of old age, and the
friends of his boyhood laid in the dust. He went to
the woman, laid his hands on her head, and wept.
The other warriors, who had lost their kindred and
sons in the war with the Walkullas, shouted and
lamented. The woman also wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the Young Eagle?&rdquo; asked the Old
Eagle of the Head Buffalo. The other warriors, in
like manner, asked for their kindred who had been
killed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fathers, they are dead,&rdquo; answered the warrior.
&ldquo;The Head Buffalo has said they are dead, and he
never lies. But let my fathers take comfort. Who
can live for ever? The foot of the swift step and
the hand of the stout bow become feeble. The eye
grows dim, and the heart of many days quails at the
fierce glance of warriors. &rsquo;Twas better they should
die like brave men in their youth than become old
men and faint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must have revenge,&rdquo; they all cried. &ldquo;We
will not listen to the young warrior who pines for
the daughter of the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they began to sing a mournful song. The
strange woman wept. Tears rolled down her cheeks,
and she often looked up to the house of the Great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Spirit and spoke, but none could understand her.
All the time the Old Eagle and the other warriors
begged that she should be burned to revenge them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brothers and warriors,&rdquo; said Chenos, &ldquo;our sons
did wrong when they broke in upon the sacred
dance the Walkullas made to their god, and he lent
his thunder to the strange warriors. Let us not
draw down his vengeance further by doing we know
not what. Let the beautiful woman remain this
night in the wigwam of the council, covered with
skins, and let none disturb her. To-morrow we will
offer a sacrifice of deer&rsquo;s flesh to the Great Spirit,
and if he will not give her to the raging fire and the
torments of the avengers, he will tell us so by the
words of his mouth. If he does not speak, it shall
be done to her as the Old Eagle and his brothers
have said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The head chief said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chenos has spoken well; wisdom is in his words.
Make for the strange woman a soft bed of skins,
and treat her kindly, for it may be she is a daughter
of the Great Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they all returned to their cabins and slept,
save the Head Buffalo, who, fearing for the woman&rsquo;s
life, laid himself down at the door of the lodge, and
watched.</p>

<p>When the morning came the warrior went to the
forest and killed a deer which he brought to Chenos,
who prepared it for a sacrifice, and sang a song while
the flesh lay on the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us listen,&rdquo; said Chenos, stopping the warriors
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
in their dance. &ldquo;Let us see if the Great Spirit hears
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They listened, but could hear nothing. Chenos
asked him why he did not speak, but he did not
answer. Then they sang again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Chenos listening. &ldquo;I hear the crowing
of the Great Turkey-cock. I hear him speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stopped, and Chenos went close to the fire
and talked with his master, but nobody saw with
whom he talked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does the Great Spirit tell his prophet?&rdquo;
asked the head chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says,&rdquo; answered Chenos, &ldquo;the young woman
must not be offered to him. He wills her to live
and become the mother of many children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many were pleased that she was to live, but those
who had lost brothers or sons were not appeased,
and they said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will have blood. We will go to the priest
of the Evil Spirit, and ask him if his master will not
give us revenge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not far from where our nation had their council
fire was a great hill, covered with stunted trees and
moss, and rugged rocks. There was a great cave in
it, in which dwelt Sketupah, the priest of the Evil
One, who there did worship to his master. Sketupah
would have been tall had he been straight, but he
was more crooked than a bent bow. His hair was
like a bunch of grapes, and his eyes like two coals of
fire. Many were the gifts our nation made to him
to gain his favour, and the favour of his master.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Who but he feasted on the fattest buffalo hump?
Who but he fed on the earliest ear of milky corn, on
the best things that grew on the land or in the water?</p>

<p>The Old Eagle went to the mouth of the cave and
cried with a loud voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sketupah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sketupah!&rdquo; answered the hoarse voice of the
Evil One from the hollow cave. He soon came and
asked the Old Eagle what he wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Revenge for our sons who have been killed by
the Walkullas and their friends. Will your master
hear us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My master must have a sacrifice; he must smell
blood,&rdquo; answered Sketupah. &ldquo;Then we shall know if
he will give revenge. Bring hither a sacrifice in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So in the morning they brought a sacrifice,
and the priest laid it on the fire while he danced
around. He ceased singing and listened, but the
Evil Spirit answered not. Just as he was going
to commence another song the warriors saw a large
ball rolling very fast up the hill to the spot where
they stood. It was the height of a man. When it
came up to them it began to unwind itself slowly,
until at last a little strange-looking man crept out
of the ball, which was made of his own hair. He
was no higher than one&rsquo;s shoulders. One of his
feet made a strange track, such as no warrior had
ever seen before. His face was as black as the shell
of the butter-nut or the feathers of the raven, and
his eyes as green as grass. His hair was of the colour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of moss, and so long that, as the wind blew it out, it
seemed the tail of a fiery star.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want of me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The priest answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Shawanos want revenge. They want to
sacrifice the beautiful daughter of the sun, whom the
Head Buffalo has brought from the camp of the
Walkullas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They shall have their wish,&rdquo; said the Evil Spirit.
&ldquo;Go and fetch her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Old Eagle and the warriors fetched her.
Head Buffalo would have fought for her, but Chenos
commanded him to be still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will see she does not
suffer.&rdquo; Then they fastened her to the stake. The
head warrior had stood still, for he hoped that the
priest of the Great Spirit should snatch her away
from the Evil One. Now he shouted his war-cry
and rushed upon Sketupah. It was in vain.
Sketupah&rsquo;s master did but breathe upon the face of
the warrior when he fell as though he had struck
him a blow, and never breathed more. Then the
Evil One commanded them to seize Chenos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, my master,&rdquo; cried Chenos, &ldquo;for the
hands of the Evil One are upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as he had said this, very far over the tall
hills, which Indians call the Backbone of the Great
Spirit, the people saw two great lights, brighter and
larger than stars, moving very fast towards the land
of the Shawanos. One was just as high as another,
and they were both as high as the goat-sucker flies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
before a thunderstorm. At first they were close
together, but as they came nearer they grew wider
apart. Soon our people saw that they were two eyes,
and in a little while the body of a great man, whose
head nearly reached the sky, came after them.
Brothers, the eyes of the Great Spirit always go
before him, and nothing is hid from his sight.
Brothers, I cannot describe the Master of Life as he
stood before the warriors of our nation. Can you
look steadily on the star of the morning?</p>

<p>When the Evil Spirit saw the Spirit of Good coming,
he began to grow in stature, and continued swelling
until he was as tall and big as he. When the Spirit
of Good came near and saw how the Evil Spirit had
grown, he stopped, and, looking angry, said, with a
voice that shook the hills&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lied; you promised to stay among the white
people and the nations towards the rising sun, and
not trouble my people more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This woman,&rdquo; replied the Evil Spirit, &ldquo;comes
from my country; she is mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is mine,&rdquo; said the Great Spirit. &ldquo;I had
given her for a wife to the warrior whom you have
killed. Tell me no more lies, bad manito, lest I
punish you. Away, and see you trouble my people
no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cowardly spirit made no answer, but shrank
down to the size he was when he first came. Then
he began as before to roll himself up in his hair,
which he soon did, and then disappeared as he came.
When he was gone, the Great Spirit shrank till he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
was no larger than a Shawano, and began talking
to our people in a soft sweet voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men of the Shawanos nation, I love you and
have always loved you. I bade you conquer your
enemies; I gave your foes into your hands. I
sent herds of deer and many bears and moose to
your hunting-ground, and made my suns shine upon
your corn. Who lived so well, who fought so
bravely as the Shawanos? Whose women bore so
many sons as yours?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you disturb the sacrifice which the
Walkullas were offering to me at the feast of green
corn? I was angry, and gave your warriors into the
hands of their enemies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shawanos, hear my words, and forget them not;
do as I bid you, and you shall see my power and my
goodness. Offer no further violence to the white
maiden, but treat her kindly. Go now and rake up
the ashes of the sacrifice fire into a heap, gathering
up the brands. When the great star of evening
rises, open the ashes, put in the body of the Head
Buffalo, lay on much wood, and kindle a fire on it.
Let all the nation be called together, for all must
assist in laying wood on the fire, but they must put
on no pine, nor the tree which bears white flowers,
nor the grape-vine which yields no fruit, nor the shrub
whose dew blisters the flesh. The fire must be
kept burning two whole moons. It must not go
out; it must burn night and day. On the first day
of the third moon put no wood on the fire, but let it
die. On the morning of the second day the Shawanos
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
must all come to the heap of ashes&mdash;every man,
woman, and child must come, and the aged who
cannot walk must be helped to it. Then Chenos
and the head chief must bring out the beautiful
woman, and place her near the ashes. This is the
will of the Great Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he had finished these words he began to
swell until he had reached his former bulk and
stature. Then at each of his shoulders came out
a wing of the colour of the gold-headed pigeon.
Gently shaking these, he took flight from the land
of the Shawanos, and was never seen in those beautiful
regions again.</p>

<p>The Shawanos did as he bade them. They raked
the ashes together, laid the body of Head Buffalo in
them, lighted the fire, and kept it burning the
appointed time. On the first day of the third moon
they let the fire out, assembled the nation around,
and placed the beautiful woman near the ashes.
They waited, and looked to see what would happen.
At last the priests and warriors who were nearest
began to shout, crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Piqua!&rdquo; which in the Shawanos tongue means a
man coming out of the ashes, or a man made of
ashes.</p>

<p>They told no lie. There he stood, a man tall and
straight as a young pine, looking like a Shawanos,
but handsomer than any man of our nation. The
first thing he did was to cry the war-whoop, and
demand paint, a club, a bow and arrows, and a
hatchet,&mdash;all of which were given him. Looking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
around he saw the white woman, and he walked up
to her, and gazed in her eyes. Then he came to the
head chief and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have that woman for my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; asked the chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man of ashes,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who made you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit; and now let me go, that I
may take my bow and arrows, kill my deer, and come
back and take the beautiful maiden for my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chief asked Chenos&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall he have her? Does the Great Spirit give
her to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the priest. &ldquo;The Great Spirit has
willed that he shall have her, and from them shall
arise a tribe to be called Piqua.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brothers, I am a Piqua, descended from the man
made of ashes. If I have told you a lie, blame not
me, for I have but told the story as I heard it.
Brothers, I have done.</p>

<h2>THE EVIL MAKER.</h2>


<p>The Great Spirit made man, and all the good things
in the world, while the Evil Spirit was asleep. When
the Evil Spirit awoke he saw an Indian, and, wondering
at his appearance, he went to him and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who made you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; thought the Evil Spirit, &ldquo;if he can make
such a being so can I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he went to work, and tried his best to make an
Indian like the man he saw, but he made some mistake,
and only made a black man. When he saw
that he had failed he was very angry, and in that
state was walking about when he met a black bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who made you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit,&rdquo; answered the bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; thought the Evil Spirit, &ldquo;I will make a
bear too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To work he went, but do what he would he could
not make a black bear, but only a grizzly one, unfit
for food. More disgusted than before, he was walking
through the forest when he found a beautiful
serpent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who made you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Great Spirit,&rdquo; replied the serpent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will make some like you,&rdquo; said the Evil
Maker.</p>

<p>He tried his best, but the serpents he made were
all noisome and poisonous, and he saw that he had
failed again.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to him that he might make some
trees and flowers, but all his efforts only resulted in
his producing some poor deformed trees and weeds.</p>

<p>Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true, I have failed in making things like the
Great Spirit, but I can at least spoil what he has
made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he went off to put murder and lies in the
hearts of men.</p>

<h2>MANABOZHO THE WOLF.</h2>


<p>Manabozho set out to travel. He wished to outdo
all others, and see new countries, but after walking
over America, and encountering many adventures, he
became satisfied as well as fatigued. He had heard
of great feats in hunting, and felt a desire to try his
power in that way.</p>

<p>One evening, as he was walking along the shores
of a great lake, weary and hungry, he encountered
a great magician in the form of an old wolf, with six
young ones, coming towards him. The wolf, as soon
as he saw him, told his whelps to keep out of the
way of Manabozho.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For I know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that it is he we see
yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young wolves were in the act of running off,
when Manabozho cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My grandchildren, where are you going? Stop,
and I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He appeared rejoiced to see the old wolf, and
asked him whither he was journeying. Being told
that they were looking out for a place where they
could find the most game, and best pass the winter,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
he said he should like to go with them, and addressed
the old wolf in these words&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brother, I have a passion for the chase. Are
you willing to change me into a wolf?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old wolf was agreeable, and Manabozho&rsquo;s
transformation was effected.</p>

<p>He was fond of novelty. He found himself a
wolf corresponding in size with the others, but he
was not quite satisfied with the change, crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! make me a little larger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little larger still,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>They said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us humour him,&rdquo; and granted his request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that will do.&rdquo; Then looking
at his tail&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;make my tail a little longer and
more bushy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They made it so, and shortly after they all started
off in company, dashing up a ravine. After getting
into the woods some distance, they fell in with the
tracks of moose. The young wolves went after them,
Manabozho and the old wolf following at their
leisure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the wolf, &ldquo;who do you think is the
fastest of my sons? Can you tell by the jumps
they take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;that one that takes such
long jumps; he is the fastest, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! You are mistaken,&rdquo; said the old wolf.
&ldquo;He makes a good start, but he will be the first to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
tire out. This one who appears to be behind will
be the first to kill the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon after they came to the place where the
young ones had killed the game. One of them had
dropped his bundle there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take that, Manabozho,&rdquo; said the old wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Esa,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;what will I do with a dirty
dog-skin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wolf took it up; it was a beautiful robe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I will carry it now,&rdquo; said Manabozho.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; replied the wolf, who at the moment
exerted his magic power. &ldquo;It is a robe of pearls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that moment he lost no opportunity of displaying
his superiority, both in the hunter&rsquo;s and
magician&rsquo;s art, over his conceited companion.</p>

<p>Coming to a place where the moose had lain down,
they saw that the young wolves had made a fresh
start after their prey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the wolf, &ldquo;this moose is poor. I
know by the tracks, for I can always tell whether
they are fat or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They next came to a place where one of the
wolves had tried to bite the moose, and, failing, had
broken one of his teeth on a tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manabozho,&rdquo; said the wolf, &ldquo;one of your grandchildren
has shot at the game. Take his arrow.
There it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;what will I do with a dirty
tooth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old wolf took it up, and, behold! it was a
beautiful silver arrow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
When they overtook the young ones, they found
they had killed a very fat moose. Manabozho was
very hungry, but, such is the power of enchantment,
he saw nothing but bones, picked quite clean. He
thought to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as I expected. Dirty, greedy fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, he sat down without saying a word, and
the old wolf said to one of the young ones&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give some meat to your grandfather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wolf, coming near to Manabozho, opened his
mouth wide as if he had eaten too much, whereupon
Manabozho jumped up, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You filthy dog, you have eaten so much that
you are ill. Get away to some other place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old wolf, hearing these words, came to Manabozho,
and, behold! before him was a heap of fresh
ruddy meat with the fat lying all ready prepared.
Then Manabozho put on a smiling-face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amazement!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;how fine the meat is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the wolf; &ldquo;it is always so with
us. We know our work, and always get the best.
It is not a long tail that makes a hunter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manabozho bit his lip.</p>

<p>They then commenced fixing their winter quarters,
while the young ones went out in search of game, of
which they soon brought in a large supply. One day,
during the absence of the young wolves, the old one
amused himself by cracking the large bones of a moose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manabozho,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;cover your head with the
robe, and do not look at me while I am at these
bones, for a piece may fly in your eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Manabozho covered his head, but, looking through
a rent in the robe, he saw all the other was about.
At that moment a piece of bone flew off and hit him
in the eye. He cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tyau! Why do you strike me, you old dog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wolf said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have been looking at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Manabozho; &ldquo;why should I
want to look at you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Manabozho,&rdquo; said the wolf, &ldquo;you must have been
looking, or you would not have got hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Manabozho; and he thought to
himself, &ldquo;I will repay the saucy wolf for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next day, taking up a bone to obtain the marrow,
he said to the old wolf&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cover your head, and don&rsquo;t look at me, for I
fear a piece may fly in your eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wolf did so. Then Manabozho took the
leg-bone of the moose, and, looking first to see if
the old wolf was well covered, he hit him a blow
with all his might. The wolf jumped up, and cried
out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you strike me so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strike you?&rdquo; exclaimed Manabozho. &ldquo;I did
not strike you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; said the wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you say I did, when you did not see me.
Were you looking?&rdquo; said Manabozho.</p>

<p>He was an expert hunter when he undertook the
work in earnest, and one day he went out and killed
a fat moose. He was very hungry, and sat down to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
eat, but fell into great doubts as to the proper point
in the carcass to begin at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where to commence.
At the head? No. People would laugh,
and say, &lsquo;He ate him backward!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he went to the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they will say I ate him sideways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then went to the hind-quarter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they will say I ate him forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last, however, seeing that he must begin the
attack somewhere, he commenced upon the hind-quarter.
He had just got a delicate piece in his
mouth when the tree just by began to make a creaking
noise, rubbing one large branch against another.
This annoyed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I cannot eat when I hear
such a noise. Stop, stop!&rdquo; cried he to the tree.</p>

<p>He was again going on with his meal when the
noise was repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot eat with such a noise,&rdquo; said he; and,
leaving the meal, although he was very hungry, he
went to put a stop to the noise. He climbed the
tree, and having found the branches which caused
the disturbance, tried to push them apart, when they
suddenly caught him between them, so that he was
held fast. While he was in this position a pack of
wolves came near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go that way,&rdquo; cried Manabozho, anxious to send
them away from the neighbourhood of his meat.
&ldquo;Go that way; what would you come to get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wolves talked among themselves, and said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>,
&ldquo;Manabozho wants to get us out of the way. He
must have something good here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I begin to know him and all his tricks,&rdquo; said an
old wolf. &ldquo;Let us see if there is anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They accordingly began to search, and very soon
finding the moose made away with the whole carcass.
Manabozho looked on wistfully, and saw them eat
till they were satisfied, when they left him nothing
but bare bones. Soon after a blast of wind opened
the branches and set him free. He went home,
thinking to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See the effect of meddling with frivolous things
when certain good is in one&rsquo;s possession!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE MAN-FISH.</h2>


<p>A very great while ago the ancestors of the
Shawanos nation lived on the other side of the
Great Lake, half-way between the rising sun and the
evening star. It was a land of deep snows and
much frost, of winds which whistled in the clear,
cold nights, and storms which travelled from seas no
eyes could reach. Sometimes the sun ceased to shine
for moons together, and then he was continually
before their eyes for as many more. In the season
of cold the waters were all locked up, and the snows
overtopped the ridge of the cabins. Then he shone
out so fiercely that men fell stricken by his fierce
rays, and were numbered with the snow that had
melted and run to the embrace of the rivers. It
was not like the beautiful lands&mdash;the lands blessed
with soft suns and ever-green vales&mdash;in which the
Shawanos now dwell, yet it was well stocked with
deer, and the waters with fat seals and great fish,
which were caught just when the people pleased to
go after them. Still, the nation were discontented,
and wished to leave their barren and inhospitable
shores. The priests had told them of a beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
world beyond the Great Salt Lake, from which the
glorious sun never disappeared for a longer time
than the duration of a child&rsquo;s sleep, where snow-shoes
were never wanted&mdash;a land clothed with
perpetual verdure, and bright with never-failing
gladness. The Shawanos listened to these tales till
they came to loathe their own simple comforts; all
they talked of, all they appeared to think of, was
the land of the happy hunting-grounds.</p>

<p>Once upon a time the people were much terrified
at seeing a strange creature, much resembling a
man, riding along the waves of the lake on the
borders of which they dwelt. He had on his head
long green hair; his face was shaped like that of a
porpoise, and he had a beard of the colour of ooze.</p>

<p>If the people were frightened at seeing a man who
could live in the water like a fish or a duck, how
much more were they frightened when they saw
that from his breast down he was actually fish, or
rather two fishes, for each of his legs was a whole
and distinct fish. When they heard him speak distinctly
in their own language, and when he sang
songs sweeter than the music of birds in spring, or
the whispers of love from the lips of a beautiful
maiden, they thought it a being from the Land of
Shades&mdash;a spirit from the happy fishing-grounds
beyond the lake of storms.</p>

<p>He would sit for a long time, his fish-legs coiled
up under him, singing to the wondering ears of the
Indians upon the shore the pleasures he experienced,
and the beautiful and strange things he saw in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
depths of the ocean, always closing his strange
stories with these words, shouted at the top of his
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me, and see what I will show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every day, when the waves were still and the
winds had gone to their resting-place in the depths
of the earth, the monster was sure to be seen near
the shore where the Shawanos dwelt. For a great
many suns they dared not venture upon the water
in quest of food, doing nothing but wander along
the beach, watching the strange creature as he
played his antics upon the surface of the waves,
listening to his songs and to his invitation&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me, and see what I will show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The longer he stayed the less they feared him.
They became used to him, and in time looked upon
him as a spirit who was not made for harm, nor
wished to injure the poor Indian. Then they grew
hungry, and their wives and little ones cried for
food, and, as hunger banishes all fear, in a few days
three canoes with many men and warriors ventured
off to the rocks in quest of fish.</p>

<p>When they reached the fishing-place, they heard
as before the voice shouting&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me, and see what I will show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently the man-fish appeared, sitting on the
water, with his legs folded under him, and his arms
crossed on his breast, as they had usually seen him.
There he sat, eying them attentively. When they
failed to draw in the fish they had hooked, he would
make the water shake and the deep echo with shouts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of laughter, and would clap his hands with great
noise, and cry&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! there he fooled you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When a fish was caught he was very angry.
When the fishers had tried long and patiently, and
taken little, and the sun was just hiding itself
behind the dark clouds which skirted the region
of warm winds, the strange creature cried out still
stronger than before&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me, and see what I will show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kiskapocoke, who was the head man of the tribe,
asked him what he wanted, but he would make no
other answer than&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; said Kiskapocoke, &ldquo;I would be
such a fool as to go I don&rsquo;t know with whom, and I
don&rsquo;t know where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See what I will show you,&rdquo; cried the man-fish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you show us anything better than we have
yonder?&rdquo; asked the warrior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will show you,&rdquo; replied the monster, &ldquo;a land
where there is a herd of deer for every one that
skips over your hills, where there are vast droves of
creatures larger than your sea-elephants, where there
is no cold to freeze you, where the sun is always soft
and smiling, where the trees are always in bloom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The people began to be terrified, and wished
themselves on land, but the moment they tried to
paddle towards the shore, some invisible hand would
seize their canoes and draw them back, so that an
hour&rsquo;s labour did not enable them to gain the length
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of their boat in the direction of their homes. At
last Kiskapocoke said to his companions&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said the fish.</p>

<p>Then Kiskapocoke said to his companions&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us follow him, and see what will come of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they followed him,&mdash;he swimming and they
paddling, until night came. Then a great wind and
deep darkness prevailed, and the Great Serpent
commenced hissing in the depths of the ocean. The
people were terribly frightened, and did not think
to live till another sun, but the man-fish kept close to
the boats, and bade them not be afraid, for nothing
should hurt them.</p>

<p>When morning came, nothing could be seen of the
shore they had left. The winds still raged, the seas
were very high, and the waters ran into their canoes
like melted snows over the brows of the mountains,
but the man-fish handed them large shells, with
which they baled the water out. As they had
brought neither food nor water with them, they had become
both hungry and thirsty. Kiskapocoke told the
strange creature they wanted to eat and drink, and
that he must supply them with what they required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the man-fish, and, disappearing
in the depths of the water, he soon reappeared,
bringing with him a bag of parched corn and a shell
full of sweet water.</p>

<p>For two moons and a half the fishermen followed
the man-fish, till at last one morning their guide
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon that they looked in the direction he pointed
out to them and saw land, high land, covered
with great trees, and glittering as the sand of the
Spirit&rsquo;s Island. Behind the shore rose tall mountains,
from the tops of which issued great flames,
which shot up into the sky, as the forks of the lightning
cleave the clouds in the hot moon. The waters
of the Great Salt Lake broke in small waves upon
its shores, which were covered with sporting seals
and wild ducks pluming themselves in the beams of
the warm and gentle sun. Upon the shore stood a
great many strange people, but when they saw the
strangers step upon the land and the man-fish, they
fled to the woods like startled deer, and were no
more seen.</p>

<p>When the warriors were safely landed, the man-fish
told them to let the canoe go; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you will never need it more.&rdquo; They had travelled
but a little way into the woods when he bade them
stay where they were, while he told the spirit of the
land that the strangers he had promised were come,
and with that he descended into a deep cave near at
hand. He soon returned, accompanied by a creature
as strange in appearance as himself. His legs and
feet were those of a man. He had leggings and
moccasins like an Indian&rsquo;s, tightly laced and beautifully
decorated with wampum, but his head was like
a goat&rsquo;s. He talked like a man, and his language

the guidance of the man-goat, into whose hands the
man-fish had put them, when he retraced his steps to
the Great Lake. They came at length to the land

in war, keen and patient in the chase. They overcame
all the tribes eastward of the River of Rivers,
and south to the shore of the Great Lake.</p>
